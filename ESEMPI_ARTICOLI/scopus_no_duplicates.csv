"Adaptive learning in computer science education: A scoping review","Barbosa P.L.S.; Carmo R.A.F.D.; Gomes J.P.P.; Viana W.","2024","Education and Information Technologies","4","Article","EN","Adaptive learning is a teaching approach aiming to personalize the learning experience for each student. In Computer Science Education (CSE), Adaptive Learning Systems (ALS) can provide students with customized lessons, exercises, and assessments based on their previous knowledge, strengths, and weaknesses. Some literature reviews focus on adaptive learning techniques, but none specifically analyze the methods used in adaptive systems in CSE. Our overall objective is to identify the computing techniques that are implemented within ALS to provide adaptive computer education in higher education. We conducted a scoping review (SR) based on the Guidelines for performing Systematic Literature Reviews in Software Engineering, defining six research questions and a search string. We performed searches in four databases, retrieving 512 documents. After applying the selection criteria, we selected 29 works. The results present quantitative and qualitative data from those 29 studies. Most research has used adaptive learning in programming education (12 articles) and databases (9 papers). Nine articles used learning styles as the core of adaptation, with the Felder-Silverman model being used by seven of them. The most commonly used approach was the rule-based system approach built by experts within the proposal, which was used in 17.24% of the articles. Clustering, collaborative filtering, fuzzy logic, and K-NN were used in 10.34% of the proposals. The positive aspect of “delivering adaptive content” was pointed out in seven articles. As for negative aspects, the problem of lack of student engagement was mentioned in four articles. This study discusses the application of dynamic and static models based on learning styles (LS) and the challenges involved in their use. Additionally, another aspect pointed out is that it is crucial to carefully consider pedagogical aspects in learning systems and have mixed development teams. The study also discusses student motivation and the use of gamification elements as a strategy to engage students in electronic learning systems. Finally, the results also indicate that the level of student knowledge is typically represented by a student model (SM), and the growing trend is the use of hybrid SMs. The research identified the most studied areas in ALS in CSE, such as computer programming and databases. The most common techniques used in ALS were rule-based systems built by experts, fuzzy logic, and clustering. The most common feature of ALS identified was learning resources, and the majority of studies focused on investigating the impact of system accuracy. This research can help researchers design better adaptive learning systems and understand challenges that need to be addressed. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023."

"Developing an Integrated STEM Classroom Observation Protocol Using the Productive Disciplinary Engagement Framework","Ong Y.S.; Koh J.; Tan A.-L.; Ng Y.S.","2024","Research in Science Education","8","Article","EN","STEM education and research has gained popularity internationally over the last decade. However, there is a lack in specifications in existing K-12 STEM classroom observation protocols of how features of an integrated STEM experience/lesson would lead to desired outcomes and how those outcomes should be measured. To bridge this gap, we propose the development of a new integrated STEM classroom observation protocol (iSTEM protocol). This article describes the ongoing development work of the iSTEM protocol, which features two creative attempts. Firstly, the productive disciplinary engagement framework is adapted to design a classroom observation protocol that provides a coherent frame of design principles to be met to achieve desired 3-dimensional pedagogical outcomes. Secondly, interdisciplinarity of student engagement was interpreted in terms of the extent to which students take a systematic and disciplinary-based approach to make and justify decisions during STEM problem-solving. The iSTEM protocol comprises 15 items (4-point scale) rated holistically for the extents to which evidence was found in the observed lesson for (1) the 3-dimensional pedagogical outcomes of productive interdisciplinary engagement (five items) and (2) problematising, resources, authority, and accountability design principles (10 items). The accompanying iSTEM profile visually represents and communicates the strengths and inadequacies in design principles, thus providing explanations for extents of students’ productive interdisciplinary engagement. The iSTEM protocol will contribute as a research tool for STEM education researchers and as a pedagogical guide for STEM classroom teachers to improve their design of STEM learning experiences. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."

Participants in this research were 342 students majoring in multidisciplinary education (preservice teachers). The distribution of participant data reflects variations in these aspects, which aims to provide a comprehensive picture of the factors that have the potential to influence students' skills in using AI. This research highlights that students with left-brain dominance show superior abilities in using AI technology compared to students with right-brain dominance. This is shown by the factor loading value on the d60 path which reached 0.98, indicating the high representational power of students with left brain dominance in mastering AI. These findings have a significant impact on approaches to technology education in universities. First, these results can encourage the development of curricula that place more emphasis on analytical and logical skills for all students, as well as introducing creative elements that can attract the interest of students with right-brain dominance. Thus, educational programs can be designed to accommodate both types of brain dominance, ensuring that students receive comprehensive and balanced training.

"Inquiry vs. Inquiry-Creative: Emphasizing Critical Thinking Skills of Prospective STEM Teachers in the Context of STEM Learning in Indonesia","Prayogi S.; Bilad M.R.; Verawati N.N.S.P.; Asy’ari M.","2024","Education Sciences","0","Article","EN","In an evolving perspective, lecturers consider that inquiry is one of the best forms of learning to drill critical thinking. This study assesses the practice of inquiry to develop the critical thinking skills of prospective science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teachers in Indonesia, which is a suitable way to address the problems in the country. Through the experimental design, three groups were formed, which were intervened with inquiry learning, inquiry-creative, and traditional teaching. The learning intervention was carried out within one month using a pre-validated instrument. The critical thinking data were analyzed descriptively based on the pre-test and post-test mean parameters and n-gain on critical thinking indicators, as well as individual critical thinking performance. Statistical analyses (paired-t test, ANOVA, and least significant difference test) were employed to provide confidence in the differences in critical thinking skills across the three learning treatments (p < 0.05). The prospective STEM teachers’ critical thinking skills showed varied performances among the three groups. The inquiry-creative group had the strongest impact, followed by inquiry and traditional teaching, all differing significantly. In summary, the findings suggest that current teaching practices in STEM education need to be reconsidered, showing the advantage of the inquiry-creative model in developing the critical thinking skills essential for future teachers and creators in the STEM fields. © 2024 by the authors."
"Game-Based Performance Tasks for Assessing Representational Flexibility of Autistic Adolescents in a Virtual World","Moon J.; Ke F.; Sokolikj Z.","2024","Technology, Knowledge and Learning","0","Article","EN","In this exploratory study, we designed and validated game-based performance tasks to assess the development of representational flexibility in autistic adolescents through virtual reality (VR)-based training. Representational flexibility, a critical cognitive ability, involves attention switching, generating representations, and recognizing patterns—skills essential for adaptive problem-solving and success in STEM education. Despite the increasing use of VR in educational interventions, limited research has explored dynamic, real-time assessment methods for representational flexibility, particularly for autistic learners. To address this gap, we conducted 71 VR-based training sessions with seven autistic adolescents, implementing a variety of game-based tasks targeting specific subsets of representational flexibility. Using both correlation and regression analyses, we evaluated the predictive validity of these tasks. Findings indicated significant relationships between task performance and representational flexibility subsets, with certain tasks demonstrating strong potential as proxies for dynamic cognitive assessments. The study highlights the viability of game-based performance tasks as an innovative approach to tracking cognitive development in immersive learning environments. Broadly, these findings contribute to advancing inclusive VR-based educational practices and assessment methodologies tailored to the unique needs of neurodiverse learners. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024."
"Enabling STE(A)M in Sustainability Education Through Dialogic/Dialectic Reconciliation","Schudel I.","2024","Educational Research for Social Change","0","Article","EN","In the context of a need for finding and enabling alternatives to unequal and extractivist perspectives on development, growth, and human well-being, this positioning paper explores possibilities for STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) education with an education for sustainable development focus that counters disciplinary alienations particularly between the arts and the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) disciplines. The paper argues that unnecessary alienations between cultural-emblematic and mathematical-logical epistemes, especially those linked to narrow interpretations and restricted developments in dialogism and dialectics, respectively, are influenced by restricted understandings of epistemological, ontological, and praxiological philosophical drivers in meaning making and responsive action. In response, the paper develops a series of philosophical principles that, it argues, could usefully underpin STEAM education practices. These are a) iterations of epistemological expansion and contraction (in response to monologic meaning making), b) an expansive and deepening ontology (in response to ontological collapse in describing the world), c) critical and judgmental rationality (finding a middle ground between radical relativism and dogma), and d) concrete utopianism (in response to idealism and additive holisticism). The emergence of the four philosophical principles is developed through illustrative examples of a broad range of arts (fine art, performance art, photography, film, poetry, prose, and music). © 2024 Ingrid Schudel."
"Immersive Virtual Labs for Enhancing In-Person and Online Education","Li Y.; Shen Y.; Sukenik C.I.","2024","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings","0","Conference paper","EN","Labs play a critical role in science and engineering education, offering practical insights and hands-on experience to students that cannot be achieved through theoretical learning alone. With the continuous advancement in technology, education is being reshaped and many universities are now offering online programs. This shift in educational paradigm offers students access to a wider range of academic resources, without being limited by geographical boundaries, time constraints, among others. However, the rise of online education also brings unique challenges, such as lack of face-to-face interaction and limited hands-on learning experiences. Virtual labs, which allow students to conduct experiments in a computer-simulated environment, can provide a viable and effective solution for online courses that require hands-on labs. Virtual Labs offer numerous advantages that can complement, and in some cases even replace, traditional in-person labs. Many educational institutions, including secondary schools and higher education institutions, face challenges in terms of establishing and maintaining traditional labs, such as high costs, space constraints, limited accessibility, among others. Virtual Labs, on the other hand, can simulate many of the experiences of a physical lab, allowing students to conduct experiments, gather data, and analyze results in a virtual environment. Virtual labs can be accessed from anywhere at any time. They can be used as pre-labs that can greatly shorten the time needed for the real physical lab or as post-labs if the student cannot complete the physical lab in the allotted time. Consequence of mistakes can be safely demonstrated in the virtual lab without exposing the student to real danger. Virtual labs can be especially useful for underrepresented groups that often do not have sufficient educational resources. This paper explores a wide range of issues in the rapid development of immersive virtual labs for engineering education, including different types of representations of the virtual environment, instrument and circuit simulation, user interface design, and integration of third-party libraries. Simulations of virtual environments often necessitate various types of representations, such as graphics models, physical models, and functional models, to optimize performance, fidelity, computational cost, and reusability. Utilization of multiple representations allows rapid development of virtual labs. For instance, the functional model of one oscilloscope can be easily adapted for another oscilloscope designed by a different manufacturer with minor modifications as oscilloscopes have similar functionalities while their visual appearance can vary. Advanced software development techniques such as object-oriented design and delegates are utilized to tackle the challenges in complex instrument and circuit simulation, such as the representation of continuous signals and discrete (digital) signals using the sampling theorem. This project makes use of the state-of-the-art design principles and techniques to create a user interface and virtual environment that are user friendly, efficient, and effective for learning. Integration of existing third-party software libraries is another crucial component in the rapid development of virtual labs. This project successfully integrated SPICE, a popular circuit simulator, as the backend of the virtual lab, greatly expediting the overall development. This paper will discuss the techniques for integration of third-party software to achieve interoperability between different software. While our current development focuses on the virtual labs for the course PHYS 303 offered at Old Dominion University (ODU), the proposed development techniques can be readily extended to other courses that utilize these common instruments, including courses offered by universities and high schools. A preliminary user study conducted with the first lab module in the course PHYS 303 demonstrated the effectiveness of the virtual lab. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024."

"Resources and Praxeologies Involved in Teachers’ Design of an Interdisciplinary STEAM Activity","Pocalana G.; Robutti O.; Ciartano E.","2024","Education Sciences","2","Article","EN","This study aimed to examine the collaborative design of an interdisciplinary STEAM activity conducted by lower-secondary school teachers of different disciplines. We adopted an approach based on a case study involving four teachers (art, music, technology, and mathematics/science teachers) designing an activity focused on the concept of symmetry. We gathered data through oral, semi-structured interviews with the teachers and through schematic representations of resource systems provided by the teachers themselves. Data analysis aimed to identify the different kinds of resources the teachers relied on, their utilization schemes, and the overarching meta-didactical praxeology adopted by the teachers for their collaborative design work. The theoretical model adopted for data analysis was a combination of the Documentational Approach to Didactics and the Meta-Didactical Transposition frameworks, originally introduced to study the work of researchers in the context of teacher professional development. An application of this model to the collaborative design work of teachers can provide a fresh insight into the relationship between teachers’ documentation work for the design of a STEAM activity, the practices that they adopt to address this shared task (praxis), and the shared justifying discourses (logos) for their praxis. © 2024 by the authors."

Colwell, is a vital and exciting part of the dynamic landscape of contemporary research, the combination of the arts and the sciences, or STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics), is recognized as pedagogical innovations of the 21st century. The creative industries are considered as intellectual capital and are growing areas of the innovative economy (Melikuzievich, 2024). Bringing together artistic and scientific approaches is not only inspiring innovation, but combining efforts to address the complex challenges that define our time. Integrating artistic methods into research and teaching makes science more accessible by translating scientific concepts into relatable narratives or vivid visuals, resulting in reaching a more diverse audience. Bridging arts education and STEM education also encourages public engagement since it is more open for dialogue and evokes responsiveness and critical thinking (OECD, 2023). These outcomes align perfectly with UNESCO's ""The Global Education 2030 Agenda"", aiming for inclusive education and equity, which underlines the importance of these interdisciplinary approaches (UNESCO, 2019). In this paper even more advantages of combining the arts and the sciences are shown, ranging from increased resourcefulness to the creation of cutting-edge solutions.

"DPGame: Game-Based Learning for Dynamic Programming Algorithms","Zhu Y.","2025","Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics) ","0","Conference paper","EN","Dynamic programming is one of the most challenging topics in data structures and algorithms courses. Students often struggle to grasp dynamic programming techniques and apply them to solve problems. The common advice to students is to study lots of dynamic programming examples. However, analyzing source code is not an engaging experience for most students. This issue motivated us to design a game-based learning environment for dynamic programming. Although game-based methods have been used in computer science education, there have been no examples of games specifically designed to teach dynamic programming. In this paper, we introduce DPGame, a multi-level puzzle game that facilitates the learning process by guiding students through the construction of dynamic programming algorithms via increasingly challenging examples. In the game, the player’s goal is to construct a logical dependency diagram by answering a series of questions, similar to assembling a visual puzzle. This game can help students identify recurring logical patterns in dynamic programming and fosters a high-level understanding of the algorithm prior to tackling the low-level details of code implementation. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025."

Within this educational framework, classroom evaluation practice is instrumental in cultivating student achievement and personal growth. This empirical study investigates how rural CHteachers' STEM literacy shapes their approach to assessing student performance, thereby impacting the effectiveness of pedagogical strategies. Utilizing self-reported data from online surveys, this study uncovers a robust positive linkage between the educators' beliefs pertaining to STEM and their evaluative techniques within the classroom setting. Specifically, instructors with strong convictions regarding STEM are more inclined to implement a variety of assessment methods, coupled with constructive evaluation principles, to bolster student learning outcomes. Furthermore, the study reveals that the STEM literacy of rural teachers serves as an intermediary between their teaching beliefs and evaluation approaches. In addition, the academic course subject instructed by these educators acts as a moderator in the relationship, underscoring the integration of humanities with STEM disciplines to achieve a balanced and comprehensive education. Highlighting the urgency of refining assessment practices and enhancing STEM literacy among rural educators, this study calls for future scholarly inquiries into the incorporation of liberal arts with STEM pedagogy. Such initiatives aim to elevate interdisciplinary teaching standards, tackle the unique challenges faced by rural regions, and promote the all-encompassing advancement of students in these areas, thereby propelling the progression of STEM education at large. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024."

Therefore, the educational standard aims to equip students with knowledge and skills necessary to capitalize on humanity's rapid progress, utilize modern achievements, and become active members of society. Moving beyond passive recipients of knowledge, students should transform into active learners capable of applying acquired knowledge for professional success and societal benefit. The paper explores the objectives of technical and science education, effectively implemented through STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), an interdisciplinary practical teaching approach. STEM education empowers children to engage in experiments, make mistakes, and draw conclusions based on personal experiences rather than solely relying on textbook information. This approach fosters active student participation and cultivates competencies such as creative and critical thinking, independent information processing, imagination, and interpretation skills. Moreover, STEM education plays a crucial role in shaping future professions that contribute to national development. While important projects have been implemented within the framework of the Millennium Program of the General Education School of Georgia to train STEM specialists, further efforts are needed. Effective school education and professional personnel training require a conducive school culture, qualified teachers, and abundant educational resources. To address this issue, our research utilized quantitative and qualitative methods, including questionnaire development, literature review, and analysis of international and local projects and training programs. These efforts aim to lay the groundwork for the preparation of STEM specialists. The paper seeks to answer key questions: Who should teach STEM, and how should STEM be taught? By ensuring the education of future generations capable of contributing to the country's economic development, political stability, and security, we aim to foster a prosperous and sustainable society. © 2024 The Authors."

"From science class to studio: supporting transformative sustainability learning among future designers","Bales A.D.; Jensen C.X.J.; Sekor M.R.; Adinolfi B.","2024","International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education","0","Article","EN","Purpose: This study aims to describe the role of design thinking in achievement of transformative sustainability learning outcomes among undergraduate art and design students to support future curricular design efforts and thereby train sustainability minded future designers. Design/methodology/approach: Baseline and culminating sustainability concept mapping assessments and reflective surveys were administered to 70 students enrolled in a general ecology and design-centric Ecology for Architects course. Correlation and regression analyses compared samples and case studies, further elucidated patterns of variation relating to the complexity and breadth of students’ sustainability knowledge and transformative potential. Findings: Students in the design-centric course performed better on transformative sustainability indicator metrics than those enrolled in the General Ecology course, driven by improvement in design applications. Complexity of sustainability knowledge improved more among the general ecology students but was accompanied by declines in transformative indicators. Increasing foundational sustainability knowledge is unlikely, on its own, to support transformative learning. Survey responses indicated students were, however, motivated to apply what they learned to their design work, with the most significant improvement in transformative indicators seen in students enrolled in the design-centric course. Originality/value: This study focuses on a population of students often marginalized in STEM education and provides a unique perspective on the value of design-centric general education courses in a population of students accustomed to design thinking pedagogies. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Unfortunately, the basic education science curriculum does not seem to prepare students to become scientifically literate for a number of reasons. Toward this vein, this calls for science teachers to be creative being at the forefront of implementing science education curriculum successfully. One mechanism to draw out their creativity is to mentor and engage them in participatory action research. Hence, a four-year professional development program for science teachers aimed at designing, implementing, and publishing participatory action research project was introduced to them by specialists from a higher education institution as their community extension project. The program consisted of mentoring on action research problem conceptualization until publication of teachers' project, continuous monitoring, and feedbacking to support their progress. Guskeys' (2000) five level evaluation model for professional development program effectiveness serves as the guiding framework for evaluation. Quantitative and qualitative data were gathered from the participating science teachers of the school. It started with conducting an initial assessment of their action research skills as basis of the proposed professional development program on participatory action research. At the end of the program, the teachers disseminated their project in a reputable science education journal. The four-year professional development program resulted to a robust impact in all five levels of Guskey's evaluation model, namely: teachers' reactions, teachers' learning, organization support and change, teachers' use of new knowledge and skills, and student learning outcomes. The success of this program highlights the importance of sustained, collaborative, and research-oriented professional development program in form of action research mentoring. Moreover, the outcomes of the study suggest the need for a professional development program evaluation framework that will facilitate the evaluation of the program effectiveness. © 2024 The Authors"

This situation can be ovewhelming, resulting in high cognitive load (CL), with consequent poor learning outcomes, and other negative issues including high dropout rates, requiring urgent attention. AI tools have been explored for addressing multiple learning issues. AI chatbots are particularly useful based on their ability to support individualized learning, pre-training, and other concepts that can facilitate CL management. This study evaluated the impact of an AI-based chatbot system for reducing students’ CL and improving learning outcomes, attitude and retention among JSS students. A quasi-experimental study with 120 students was conducted over an 8 week period with 24 learning sessions. The experimental group (N=60) learnt using ‘iLearnTech’, an AI Chatbot developed specifically for the study. The control group (N=60) learnt through the traditional approach with no chatbot. Learning content was based on the JSS Basic Technology education, a precursor to TVET. Data was collected using the Cognitive Load Measure, the Basic Technology Achievement Test, Students’ Attitude Survey (SAS), and Students’ Retention Test. The experimental group exhibited huge reductions in CL and corresponding improvements in learning outcomes, attitude and retention. The results also confirmed known relationship between the dependent variables and highlights the potential of AI powered educational tools for addressing diverse educational issues including promoting equitable access, and sustainable education in developing nations and resource-constrained environments. This work contributes to ongoing discussions on AI applications in education. Its novelty lies in its exploration of AI technology in addressing CL issues in the context of junior secondary education.

"Extracting the actions of contextual understanding in STEAM research: Direction for STEAM course design","Liu C.-Y.; Wu C.-J.","2025","Thinking Skills and Creativity","0","Article","EN","The arts could be a catalyst to engage students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. Combining science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics (STEAM) is more likely to help students comprehend how scientific knowledge and practices relate to the problems they encounter daily. By encouraging students’ reflections on the sociocultural environment, other people's perspectives, and science history through STEM instruction, “contextual understanding” refers to the most distinctive meaning of art that can highlight the distinctiveness of each context. However, as the meaning of contextual understanding is fairly abstract and concrete actions that learners must display when engaging in STEAM activities have not been defined, it is difficult to provide directions for designing STEAM courses. Thus, we aimed to validate a coding scheme that included four concrete actions of contextual understanding: identification, analysis, moral response, and exhibition. Eleven STEAM researchers participated in the semi-structured interviews. The coding scheme was validated by revealing a fairly similar pattern. Most STEAM researchers concentrated on identifying students in their personal and community histories, fostering their analysis skills, particularly clarifying context by perspective-taking, and letting them demonstrate their learning through explanatory exhibitions in scientific and historical ways; only one researcher instructed students to reflect on ethics. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd"

In order to educate future computer scientists to be able to assess and create technology in a conscious and responsible manner, we provide first-year Computer Science (CS) students with an introductory course on different ways of thinking about CS by offering them a transdisciplinary view of the field. As we continuously strive to use engaging teaching methods to foster long-lasting interest for the topics of the course, as well as enhancing students’ learning experiences, we have introduced a unique game-based learning pipeline: In a game design course, advanced CS students design non-digital games that address various topics from the introductory course. These games are later played by first-year CS students, who are reflecting on the content and their experience as a part of their course assignments. In order to learn from the first iteration of this process, we analyse one of the games created, in particular its design and the educational objectives intended by the game designers, including the students’ feedback. We found that the game was perceived to be good in achieving learning outcomes; however, it scored even higher in terms of being an interesting and entertaining game. Overall, we conclude that the game was successful in creating an engaging learning experience, demonstrating the potential for game-based learning with non-digital games. This case study also highlights the importance of creating a suitable environment for game-based learning approaches to enhance the educational effects and utilise individual strengths of educational games, providing inspiration and groundwork for future research. © 2024 Dechema e.V..

The CHARLIE project, an “ERASMUS+ KA2” initiative involving six partners across five European countries, is a beacon of innovation in addressing the critical need for algorithmic biases and ethical education in AI and ML. Our project objectives centre on enhancing the capacity of Higher Education (HE) institutions to deliver socially responsible and ethically informed tech education, particularly in AI and ML domains. By integrating digital and engaging pedagogical strategies, we aim to increase tech students’ social and ethical competencies and equip educators with effective tools for teaching these critical topics. CHARLIE focuses on cultivating an ethical, human-centered perspective in technology education, specifically targeting the youth demographic. One of the practical outputs from CHARLIE is the development of a competency matrix and the 'Algorithmic Bias' course. This course, designed with a blended learning approach and complemented by a 'Digital Game' to assess learning outcomes, is a testament to the project's real-world applicability. Additionally, the project focuses on creating effective linkages between HE, Adult Education (AE), and Youth sectors to facilitate widespread adoption and recognition of ethical AI curricula. This method is chosen for its potential to engage young learners in complex subjects by integrating learning with interactive, scenario-based gameplay that reflects real-world dilemmas. The games complement theoretical knowledge with practical decision-making exercises that promote critical thinking and ethical reasoning.

"How hermeneutics can guide grading in integrated STEAM education: An evidence-informed perspective","DeLuca C.; Dubek M.; Rickey N.","2024","British Educational Research Journal","2","Article","EN","Addressing calls to develop assessment theories for integrated teaching and learning, we propose an evidence-informed perspective on grading in Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics (STEAM) education. We leveraged a qualitative collective case study design to generate rich profiles of three exemplary STEAM teachers' grading approaches and practices. Data sources included semi-structured interviews and artefacts of teachers' instruction and assessment practice. We analysed qualitative data from interviews and artefacts using a general inductive approach. The teachers in our study pushed back against ‘objective’ views of grading, whereby grades are composites of summative assessments, in favour of informed and contextualised grading, which aims to document and support a negotiated understanding of each student's learning journey. Teachers' grading practices aligned with a hermeneutic approach to classroom assessment validity: the teachers (a) collected and interpreted a wide range of evidence of student (re)learning; (b) centred students' perspectives and evidences; and (c) employed their professional judgement to determine students' grades. Teachers characterised grading as a process of accounting for all available evidence, blurring the boundaries between formative and summative assessment. Documenting the learning process, rather than focusing on products, can support deeply integrated learning. Importantly, the teachers supported students in documenting their own learning and negotiating their grades with reference to self-generated evidence. This practice stands to reduce power imbalances between students and teachers and foster students' self-regulated learning. Our findings inform a framework which STEAM educators can use to guide grading in integrated classrooms, an enduring challenge for integrated learning. © 2024 British Educational Research Association."

"Edu-tainment in STEM: Exploring the Feasibility of Television-based Educational Games in Engineering Education","Saleem A.; Jeelani I.","2024","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings","0","Conference paper","EN","In the contemporary landscape of STEM education, a significant challenge lies in ensuring student engagement and facilitating the understanding of complex engineering concepts. Traditional teaching methods are passive and often struggle to sufficiently engage the young generation of students. While passive learning is important for understanding and remembering concepts, it is not efficient for developing high-level skills, such as applying, analyzing, and evaluating the material. The active learning approach, where students learn by engaging with the content, is beneficial for the development of high-level skills in students and has been shown to improve learning and retention. Interacting with the content better engages students which help them improve their concentration and deepens their learning. Hence, visions for engaging instructional methods such as game-based learning need to be explored for STEM education. The young generation of students are habituated to television and video games; therefore, an opportunity exits to integrate popular media-based themes with educational content to create enriched learning experiences. This paper presents a novel approach of game-based learning: the Television Media-based Educational Game (TMEG). Conceptually, TMEG provides a framework to embed the educational content within an engaging narrative inspired by a popular TV series, aiming to enhance both student engagement and learning. TMEG incorporates 3D models, animations, and visuals that are tailored to introduce different engineering principles. The game's narrative is crafted to mirror themes from a TV series, selected based on student interests, creating a relatable and immersive learning environment. This study developed a prototype game for an introductory Materials Science and Engineering course. This process consisted of two steps: First, a student survey was conducted to identify the TV series that is popular among the students. This provided the backdrop of the game. The survey also identified the course concepts that students find challenging, which formed the educational content of the game. Second step focused on the technical development of the game using the TMEG framework. Unity game engine was used to develop the game that embedded the identified educational content within the selected TV series-based theme. The game used game tasks, animations, videos to deliver the educational content within the game narrative. The outcomes of this research could lay a foundation for the future development of innovative and engaging educational games and extend the reach of such pedagogical strategies across various STEM and non-STEM fields. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024."

"A quasi-experimental study on the advantages of digital gamification using CoSpaces Edu application in science education","Khattib H.; Alt D.","2024","Education and Information Technologies","3","Article","EN","Digital technology has broadened educational opportunities in science, positioning gamification as a pivotal tool. However, its full potential in enhancing science education has not been thoroughly explored. Addressing this research gap, this study delves into the less examined aspects of gamification within science education. Employing a quasi-experimental design, it assesses the benefits of digital gamification activities, specifically using the CoSpaces Edu application (experimental group), against traditional face-to-face methods (control group). The experimental group engaged in a 3D educational digital game using Cospaces Edu, which was tailored to each grade level and covered topics from the science and technology curriculum. In contrast, the control group participated in a tabletop game addressing the same topics as those presented to the experimental group. The study involved 176 students from grades 4 to 6, focusing on how these methods impact their gameful experiences, motivation to play, and level of immersion. The results of multivariate analyses of covariance revealed statistically significant differences between the groups on all measured variables, highlighting the superiority of the CoSpaces Edu application over face-to-face activities. The study underscores the positive effects of gamification on various unexplored aspects of science and technology education, advocating for the integration of technology and diverse teaching methods. The primary conclusion is that integrating digital games into science lessons significantly enhances students’ perceptions of accomplishment, challenge, playfulness, immersion, and motivation to engage in an educational game, compared to traditional face-to-face games. This study reinforces the value of technological integration in science teaching and supports the need for diversified teaching methodologies. Further research is necessary to validate this conclusion, as the study’s concentration on particular age groups in a single elementary school limits the generalizability of its results. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024."

This study introduces the Answers platform, a pioneering online learning environment developed at TU Delft. This research aims to reimagine the learning experience for Bachelor and Master of Science Students in computer science by integrating gamification elements grounded in Wenger's value creation framework. Our paper explores two critical research questions: the perception of learners towards gamified learning experiences and the impact of the Answers' system on value creation and motivation. We incorporated points, badges, and leaderboards in a semester-long intervention to enrich the learning landscape. The Value Creation Questionnaire (VCQ) results indicated that the platform effectively created potential and applied value, significantly enhancing students' learning practices and motivation. However, its impact on fostering social connections could have been more pronounced. The platform also moderately influenced students' ability to impact their world and shift perspectives. The Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) revealed that students generally enjoyed using the platform but felt it did not significantly enhance feelings of connectedness. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge by demonstrating the efficacy of gamification in computer science education and offering insights into the design of engaging online learning platforms. By bridging theoretical frameworks with practical application, the Answers platform exemplifies the potential of gamified environments to revolutionize educational practices in the digital age. © 2024 Dechema e.V..

"Creative pedagogies in digital STEAM practices: natural, technological and cultural entanglements for powerful learning and activism","Chappell K.; Hetherington L.","2024","Cultural Studies of Science Education","1","Article","EN","This paper delves deeply into the creative pedagogies which support cutting edge digital STEAM practice across primary and secondary school settings. It contextualises the research within current STEAM agendas including transdisciplinarity, and STEAM and technology and goes on to offer insight from the novel context of ocean learning to develop and extend a theorisation of creative pedagogies as entwining both creative teaching and teaching for creativity as embodied, democratic, dialogic and material processes. Intra-action between theory, praxis, nature, culture, the digital and humans enables an emergent perspective about changing the dynamics of power to develop ocean or environmental learning and related activism. Derived from research into an ocean education project, which aimed to develop students’ ocean literacy through the combined educative principles of creative pedagogies and digital technologies (Augmented and Virtual Realities), the research draws on data from six projects across primary and secondary school settings in Denmark, Spain and England. It used a ‘diffractive’ analytic technique, inspired by new materialist theory, to explore the messy mixtures of natural, cultural and technological environments that were being learned through. This involved the development of four material-dialogic assemblages each including diffractive switches. Each is presented first through a ‘piece’ which demonstrates each assemblage’s connection to the core question, followed by ‘ripples’, which briefly articulate the new learning and questions arising from that assemblage. The four assemblages cover the irresistibility of making kin, the relationships between lively bodies and virtual environments, the importance of spacetimematter in environmental edu-activism and trajectories between transience, stability and dialogic space. The paper leaves the reader/engager with a selection of prompts to highlight the research’s contribution to current STEAM agendas related to changing power dynamics, and to provoke reader/engagers’ own practices. These can include new pedagogies and activisms, as well as theoretical developments to the combined educative principles of creative pedagogies and digital technologies within STEAM education. © The Author(s) 2023."

The familiar environment of pens and paper also lessens the cognitive load of students with no prior experience with computers, for whom the mere basic usage of computers can be intimidating. Finally, this teaching approach opens learning opportunities to students with limited access to computers. However, a key obstacle is the current lack of teaching methods and support software for working with and running handwritten programs. Optical character recognition (OCR) of handwritten code is challenging: Minor OCR errors, perhaps due to varied handwriting styles, easily make code not run, and recognizing indentation is crucial for languages like Python but is difficult to do due to inconsistent horizontal spacing in handwriting. Our approach integrates two innovative methods. The first combines OCR with an indentation recognition module and a language model designed for post-OCR error correction without introducing hallucinations. This method, to our knowledge, surpasses all existing systems in handwritten code recognition. It reduces error from 30% in the state of the art to 5% with minimal hallucination of logical fixes to student programs. The second method leverages a multimodal language model to recognize handwritten programs in an end-to-end fashion. We hope this contribution can stimulate further pedagogical research and contribute to the goal of making CS education universally accessible.

Technological literacy among older people is a critical factor in social exclusion. This study seeks to provide senior citizens with competencies in scientific, artistic, mathematical, and technological domains by enhancing scientific and technological literacy. The research developed a series of non-formal education sessions on the golden ratio using a STEAM educational approach. A quantitative methodology approach was carried out by using a diagnostic survey of the participants’ conceptions and a subsequent quasi-experimental study to evaluate the impact of the intervention. This study, conducted with 37 senior citizens (n = 37), found positive results aligning with the existing literature on the potential of the STEAM approach. The STEAM approach proved to be engaging for seniors, offering a holistic and interdisciplinary educational experience. Despite the limited availability of science educational programs for seniors and the scarcity of studies on lifelong learning using the STEAM approach, this research highlights the need for such initiatives, especially given the growing senior population. Applying STEAM education shows promise in enhancing scientific literacy and motivation among adult learners. By integrating mathematical concepts, such as the golden ratio, with practical applications in arts and natural sciences, STEAM education can provide a rich, motivating, and accessible learning experience, promoting active and healthy ageing through lifelong learning. Further research and development in this area could maximise educational benefits for the senior population. © 2024 by the authors."

Using an analysis of scholarly publications based on word co-occurrence, this study aimed to identify the main research themes addressed in the past decade by the scholarly community on game-based teaching and learning solutions in the context of STEM education in secondary schools, their evolution over time, and the key issues addressed in recent years. After a systematic selection, the titles and abstracts of the publications were collected in a text corpus and analyzed using T-LAB software version 7.2.1.4 (2022). A preliminary visual exploration of the keywords was performed to obtain an overall view of the issues addressed by the research. Specificity analysis was then applied to identify, for each subset of the corpus identified by the years of publication, the evolution of themes reflected in a change in the frequency of lemma use. Finally, to explore the most recent topics, the main thematic clusters of publications in the last three years were identified (thematic analysis of elementary contexts). The results suggest some changes in the issues addressed over the past decade, such as a shift in focus from the specific technologies and competitive elements of games to understanding how GBL can support engagement, motivation, and understanding of complex scientific concepts. The five key thematic clusters identified (“Experience”, “Application”, “Validation”, “Emotion”, and “Programming”) also indicate a stronger emphasis by the latest publications on the experiential and emotional components of learning, the need for empirical studies, and the integration of computational thinking and coding into GBL.

This localized approach is indeed valuable on a disciplinary level, but the greater efficacy of DBER as a field of study hinges on scholars finding a common ground to construct a broadly applicable understanding that transcends disciplinary boundaries. This NSF-funded project ventures into DBER that has the potential to be transformative in the field of STEM education, particularly in the emerging sub-area of STEM entrepreneurship education research. The project investigates entrepreneurship education programs (EEPs) from a conceptual perspective, seeking to understand the factors influencing women faculty's participation in these educational programs. Specifically, this project draws from research conducted in disparate fields to capture the essence of adult participation theories and theoretical foundations from entrepreneurship education literature. This confluence of these theories culminates in creating a unified, overarching framework that serves as a model for systematic investigations into entrepreneurship program participation across various academic disciplines. Furthermore, it situates itself within the intricate socio-cultural landscape of STEM academia, ensuring that the developed conceptual understanding encapsulates the lived experiences of women STEM faculty within the systemic norms of STEM disciplines. In this paper, we illuminate the complex and multifaceted factors influencing women STEM faculty's involvement in EEPs, shedding light on the interplay between personal experiences, systemic challenges, and the broader socio-cultural context. Moreover, we provide a synthesis of interdisciplinary theoretical perspectives that serve as a lens for conducting and analyzing in-depth interviews with a diverse sample of 32 women STEM faculty. Overarchingly, the project aims to contribute to the development of EEPs that engage a more extensive and diversified women STEM faculty population. The project's findings are anticipated to provide the entrepreneurship education community with a research-based conceptual understanding for the development of EEPs that are inclusive and, in turn, promote the participation of women STEM faculty. In summary, this research endeavors to advance the understanding of factors influencing women STEM faculty's participation in entrepreneurship education programs and contributes to the creation of an inclusive and equitable landscape for entrepreneurship education across STEM disciplines [1]. By merging multiple theories into a unified model, this project offers a creative way of leveraging interdisciplinary perspectives, underscoring the importance of a shared theoretical foundation for effective education research. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024."

Teachers we worked with were highly interested in their Indigenous knowledge heritage. Yet, they reported that they, and the young teachers they work with, simply do not have the heritage knowledge capital to include Indigenous knowledge systems in their teaching. Other challenges they face are the time it takes to engage community knowledge holders, and to find knowledge relating to school subject disciplines. The teachers observed that students prioritise modernity over Indigenous heritage and technologies, often undervaluing the latter as a forgotten past. Three exploratory cases delved into teacher education's response to challenges through co-engaged work, and this paper synthesises the emerging evidence—aiming to refine pedagogical tools for integrating Indigenous knowledge into STEAM education.

Most existing kits are designed with clear-cut, narrowly defined end goals for learners to accomplish. The lessons typically do not include teaching design concepts, and do not offer opportunities for crafting, personalization, and storytelling. We offer a more flexible and creative kit design; integrating concepts such as design thinking, iterative design, and collaboration.

"Longitudinal analysis of teacher self-efficacy evolution during a STEAM professional development program: a qualitative case study","Jiang H.; Chugh R.; Zhai X.; Wang K.; Wang X.","2024","Humanities and Social Sciences Communications","3","Article","EN","Despite the widespread advocacy for the integration of arts and humanities (A&H) into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education on an international scale, teachers face numerous obstacles in practically integrating A&H into STEM teaching (IAT). To tackle the challenges, a comprehensive five-stage framework for teacher professional development programs focussed on IAT has been developed. Through the use of a qualitative case study approach, this study outlines the shifts in a participant teacher’s self-efficacy following their exposure to each stage of the framework. The data obtained from interviews and reflective analyses were analyzed using a seven-stage inductive method. The findings have substantiated the significant impact of a teacher professional development program based on the framework on teacher self-efficacy, evident in both individual performance and student outcomes observed over eighteen months. The evolution of teacher self-efficacy in IAT should be regarded as an open and multi-level system, characterized by interactions with teacher knowledge, skills and other entrenched beliefs. Building on our research findings, an enhanced model of teacher professional learning is proposed. The revised model illustrates that professional learning for STEAM teachers should be conceived as a continuous and sustainable process, characterized by the dynamic interaction among teaching performance, teacher knowledge, and teacher beliefs. The updated model further confirms the inseparable link between teacher learning and student learning within STEAM education. This study contributes to the existing body of literature on teacher self-efficacy, teacher professional learning models and the design of IAT teacher professional development programs. © The Author(s) 2024."

The sample consisted of 57 teachers (24 in the control group and 33 in the experimental group) recruited using purposive convenience sampling. The study adopted a mixed embedded design. Quantitative data analysis included independent samples t-tests, paired samples t-tests, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, and effect size calculations. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze qualitative data, including the nature of the engineering questionnaire and lesson plans. The experimental group engaged in TRIZ-STEM activities using an online flipped learning model, while the control group engaged in face-to-face TRIZ-STEM education activities. The results showed that online TRIZ-STEM education had a greater positive impact on teachers' perspectives on engineering nature than face-to-face TRIZ-STEM education. On the other hand, face-to-face TRIZ-STEM education was much more effective in helping participants develop problem-solving skills than online flipped learning TRIZ-STEM education. However, the online flipped learning model did not show superiority in improving teachers' creative thinking education and STEM teaching compared to the face-to-face approach. Based on the results, suggestions for future research were provided, emphasizing the potential of online flipped learning models for STEM teacher education. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023."

This study examines the influence of a gamified approach on improving graphic design education. By implementing this methodology, we aim to create a more dynamic learning environment that could lead to better academic outcomes. Methods: A quasi-experimental design was employed to compare students' average grades and academic achievements using the gamified technique with those taught using conventional methods. Thirty-two students participated in the study, with these students enrolled in three different terms. Data collection involved tracking students' grades, participation, and completion rates of gamified activities. Results: Participants in the August—December 2023 semester (Experimental 2 group) who experienced the gamified approach with the proposed platform showed significant improvement, with a p-value of 0.033, compared to those in the August—December 2022 semester (Control group), which used only conventional approaches. Furthermore, better learning outcomes were obtained when the Experimental 2 group was compared with the January-May 2023 semester (Experimental 1 group), which used only the gamification methodology (p-value = 0.025). Additionally, out of 15 students in the Experimental 2 group, 10 achieved certification in Adobe Illustrator and 13 in Photoshop, suggesting that gamification elements applied through a digital platform can improve academic performance and enhance students' practical skills and readiness for professional challenges in graphic design. Discussion: Results indicate that the gamified methodology can improve learning outcomes. Nevertheless, the proposed approach also has limitations and areas for improvement. Manual data capture, integration with external tools, the amount of teachers applying the approach, and the sample size of participants are limitations of the study that could have affected the accuracy of the results. Future work will focus on developing a proprietary platform that integrates course content and automates the tracking system to improve efficiency and accuracy.

An abundance of well-developed lesson plans is available to teachers on numerous Internet sites, but the cultural diversity of such lesson plans – i.e., difficulty to customize for alignment with local curriculum and lesson plan requirements, make it difficult for teachers to utilize and share these resources – due to the lack of flexible customizations for orientation with local curriculum and lesson plan requirements. This study suggests an approach to overcome such challenges by presenting the DLP tool to assist teachers’ STEAM teaching practices using GeoGebra for learning content elaboration. Our proposed transdisciplinary STEAM practice uses architecture as a real-life example that connects mathematics learning to culture and history through mathematical modelling. This study follows a design-based research approach to develop and implement DLP tool and its related design heuristic. Moreover, the study is examining how the DLP tool can be utilized with teachers cross-culturally and how it could support teachers in professional development workshops to design transdisciplinary STEAM lesson plans. The qualitative analysis of teachers’ artefacts developed during these workshops demonstrated the versatility of DLP tool to address cultural diversity in lesson planning through these STEAM practices applications.

The observational research touched on 1) game-based learning in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, and 2) learning motivation in vulnerable student groups. This paper focuses on the authors' experiences, most of them early researchers focused on science education, their purpose of promoting game-based learning in STEM education, and interviews with representatives from both institutions. We found that game-based learning was seen as a novelty, innovative, and motivational way of engaging young students from institutional care settings to learn and become curious about the STEM field. We also designed and created games focused on STEM subjects in both institutions. Students living in institutional care settings face even greater obstacles regarding education. In some instances, the lack of mentorship or follow-up tutoring activities can determine their academic outcome or lack thereof. With the ever-changing world of technology, industries demand highly qualified people in STEM fields. Nonetheless, international organizations such as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have reported that school systems around the world are not equipped with the proper teaching methodologies for students to acquire basic skills such as mathematics nor critical thinking. In Mexico, public school systems and institutional care settings often lack teacher training or mentorship approaches to promote STEM education.

However, there is no general assessment tool for those STEAM creations, so as to help parents or instructors to experience and evaluate the STEAM products created or sold by companies or proposed by academic institutes when they want to introduce one to their children or students. Therefore, this study developed and validated an assessment of STEAM Creation with formative constructs by utilizing the PLS-SEM technique. The four constructs taken into account based on the theoretical foundations were computational thinking (CT) levels, design thinking (DT) levels, STEAM interdisciplinary levels, and literacy-oriented (LO) levels. CT was operationalized as four indicators (i.e., problem decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithm steps), and DT was operationalized as another four indicators (i.e., analysis of design requirements, creative brainstorming, hands-on experience, and test and verification). Meanwhile, STEAM was operationalized with five indispensable indicators, where each indicator refers to one discipline. LO was operationalized with three indicators (i.e., cooperation and co-creation, problem solving, and daily application). There were 16 indicators in total. Therefore, the formative relationship was established and evaluated in this study. This paper assessed STEAM creations with a formative measurement model comprising four hypotheses indicating that CT has a significant direct effect on STEAM and LO, DT has a significant direct effect on STEAM while STEAM has a significant direct effect on LO. The results reveal that all four hypotheses were accepted and the paths in the model were confirmed. CT has a significant indirect effect on LO through STEAM, which was also deeply discussed. © 2022, The Author(s)."

"Applying Physics Knowledge and STEAM Education in High School: Connecting Traditional Vietnamese Culture Through the Moon-Shaped Lute Production Project","Ha N.T.T.","2024","European Journal of Educational Research","0","Article","EN","This article explores the integration of physics knowledge and science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) education in high schools through a unique project that connects traditional Vietnamese culture with the production of moon-shaped lutes. The moon-shaped lute, known as “Đàn Nguyêt” in Vietnamese, holds great cultural significance in Vietnam. By incorporating physics principles into the lute production process, students develop a deeper understanding of its construction, sound production, and structural stability. They explore concepts like material selection, sound propagation, and ergonomic design to enhance the instrument’s craftsmanship and playability. This interdisciplinary approach not only fosters scientific and technical skills but also preserves and promotes traditional Vietnamese culture. Engaging students in projects that combine art, science, and culture highlights the power of STEAM education in nurturing well-rounded individuals who have a strong connection to their heritage. The integration of physics knowledge and cultural elements in this project demonstrates the value of interdisciplinary learning and its impact on students’ appreciation for their cultural identity. © 2024 Eurasian Society of Educational Research.

"Exploring Children’s Online Summer Camp Adventures through Creativity and Problem Solving","Gecu-Parmaksiz Z.; Hughes J.","2024","Education Sciences","0","Article","EN","Summer camps can help children continue to learn beyond school, build knowledge, keep their learning skills sharp, and help them prepare for the following school year. This paper presents participants’, facilitators’, and researchers’ experiences in a “Problem Solvers Camp” held in the Maker Lab at an Ontario University. A total of 12 junior students participated in a one-week summer camp, during which the participants developed plausible solutions for mathematical and instant problems using their creativity while learning some mathematical concepts. The creative learning spiral (CLS) model was adopted while designing the learning activities. Throughout the camp, children had the opportunity to work with virtual tech tools to design, create, and play to complete their challenges. Afterward, they shared their work for feedback and generated new ideas to promote their creative learning. The data were collected through observations, participants’ work, and their portfolios to highlight the campers’ experiences throughout the camp. On the last day of the camp, the researchers also ran focus group interviews. Data analysis showed that CLS might offer engaging environments that enhance children’s creative and reflective thinking skills to solve real-life problems. This study enabled children to engage in all stages of the CLS during problem solving, encouraging the exchange of ideas and opinions. The implementation of the CLS model also has the potential to inspire creativity and enhance learners’ fluency and elaboration skills, especially when complemented by technological or coding tools. © 2024 by the authors."

"Channelling Artscience Through Fan-Fiction for Diversifying STEM Approaches in Participatory Learning in Malaysia","Lee C.A.L.","2023","American Behavioral Scientist","4","Article","EN","Fan-fiction is proposed as a participatory and discovery-learning approach to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education; communication; and collaboration through the epistemic third space afforded by artscience. The objective is to increase the affective dimension in STEM instruction by allowing STEM to enter intimately into social spaces, all the while drawing interests from girls and women. There is strong female participation in fan-fiction creation, whether in the form of textual stories or other transmedia objects, that could be used to develop more multi-dimensional STEM-based experiential and imagination-centric learning without excluding the more technical aspects of the science – in fact, the technical aspects could be weaved in as a STEM problem or project to be collectively tackled through the communal experience of creating and responding to fan-fiction. Moreover, the world-building capability of fan-fiction, with its ability to bring together multiple fandoms such as multiple works from the same creator or different creators within similar genres, means that there is ample room for using fan-fiction during interdisciplinary engagement for STEM problem-solving or research creation approaches to learning and doing. In this article, some examples of activities are taken from workshops targeted at Malaysian audiences to explore the possibility of deploying fan-fiction approaches to STEM, or STEM through the lenses of artscience, within the culture of learning and doing in Malaysia. These workshops were not originally conceived with fan-fiction as method and medium in mind and yet, were found to share certain similar traits with fan-fiction. The world-building capacity of fan-fiction could be deployed to mainstream the incorporation of indigenous and cultural ways of knowing within Malaysia into the rubrics of institutionalized STEM education. However, the convergence and compatibility between fan-fiction and participatory design, which were featured in at least three of the four workshops depicted here, are the reasons for the choice, while the fourth workshop considers the practice of fan-fiction and its relevance to more informal practices in STEM publishing and communication at a meta level. © 2022 SAGE Publications."

The efficacy of humanly made artifacts in educational settings are widely studied in art, communications, and more recently in STEM education. Physical objects have proven to promote the understanding of STEM concepts, increase test scores, improve technical communication skills, encourage participation in constructivist learning activities and manage cognitive load for difficult subjects [1] - [9]. In engineering education, the benefits of tangible objects have been predominantly studied in subjects like design. Studies have shown that engagement with mechanical objects improves students' performance on producing assembly instructions, students are more engaged and in-control of their learning helps with transforming their conceptual knowledge into ideas for product design [1]. Engineers are surrounded by physical artifacts throughout their education and work-place environments. Our research project addresses the effectiveness of such interventions for engineering design, problem solving, including conceptual understanding of abstract and difficult concepts. Further, the study explores the relationship of mechanical objects and mechanical engineering students when learning abstract and difficult concepts related to thermodynamics. In order to identify cognitive processes involved in solving engineering related problems, the current study investigates how students engage in problem- solving and attempt to use mechanical objects. Therefore the research question this study investigates is: How do interactions with mechanical objects cognitively support solving conceptually difficult problems in thermodynamics?

This paper discusses an approach for bridging the gap between Computational Thinking with Data Science by employing and studying classification as a higher-order thinking process that connects the two. To achieve that, we designed and developed an online constructionist gaming tool called SorBET which integrates coding and database design enabling students to interpret, organize, and analyze data through game play and game design. The paper presents and discusses the results of a pilot study that aimed to investigate the data practices secondary students develop through playing and modifying SorBET games, and to determine the impact of game modding on student critical engagement with CT. According to the results, students developed and used certain data practices such as data interpretation and data model design to become better players or to design an interesting classification game. Moreover, game modding process motivated students to question the original games’ content, leading them to develop a critical stance towards the game data model and representations. © 2024 Vilnius University"

In this paper the authors discuss a distinct model, theorised from a five-year study of a particular, innovative STEAM education project (The Imagineerium), and developed by the researchers through working with primary school teachers in England within a second project (Teach-Make). The paper examines how teachers implemented this model, the Trowsdale art-making model for education (the TAME), and reflected on its value and positive impact on their planning and pedagogy. Design/methodology/approach: The paper draws on two studies: firstly, a five-year, mixed methods, participative study of The Imagineerium and secondly a participative and collaborative qualitative study of Teach-Make. Findings: Study of The Imagineerium showed strong positive educational outcomes for pupils and an appetite from teachers to translate the approach to the classroom. The Teach-Make project showed that with a clear curriculum model (the TAME) and professional development to improve teachers' planning and active pedagogical skills, they could design and deliver “imagineerium-like” schemes of work in their classrooms. Teachers reported a positive impact on both their own approach to supporting learning, as well as pupil progression and enjoyment. Originality/value: The paper argues that the TAME, a consolidation of research evidence from The Imagineerium and developed through Teach-Make, offers both a distinctive and effective model for STEAM and broader education, one that is accessible to, valued by and manageable for teachers. © 2023, Jo Trowsdale and Richard Davies."

In this scenario, new educational technology tools and immersive learning affordances (possibilities), offer unprecedented potential for the design of smart and dynamic learning systems and contexts that can enhance learning processes across varied audiences and educational settings. However, current STEAM education practice lacks attention to equipping all citizens with the necessary skills to use digital technologies in an ethical, critical and creative way. This gap calls for attention in design processes, principles and practices that are attentive to ethical considerations and values-based approaches. On the other hand, in its formulation STEAM as an educational approach is framed in four fundamental pillars: creativity, inclusion, citizenship and emerging technologies, which also put attention on the inclusion of disadvantaged and underrepresented social groups during STEAM education design.

There is, however, insufficient discussion on how to design STEM activities for developing primary students' problem-solving skills and digital creativity. This study discusses the pedagogical design of STEM activities for these purposes. The development of problem-solving skills and digital creativity through the six-step STEM pedagogy of 'to play, to inquire, to STEM, to code, to reflect, and to create' in STEM activities is proposed in this chapter. The problem-solving skills involved in our STEM activities are causal reasoning (science), conditional reasoning and coding (mathematics and technology), sequencing (mathematics), and engineering systems thinking (engineering). In the digital era, it is useful to teach the building of systems to enable students to experience the making of physical artefacts that can operate automatically. Involving digital devices in STEM activities allows for the automated operation of physical artefacts through systems that involve sensing of data from the environment, conditional reasoning through coding using collected data, and reacting sensibly to the environment. Sensing, reasoning, and reacting are essential concepts of the Internet of Things (IoT), which is particularly important in the digital era. It is far from sufficient to teach students only how to solve problems. They must also learn to be creative and transfer what they have learnt to other contexts.

This study strategically integrated computational thinking (CT), STEM, and CDIO engineering design, based on Action-Process-Object-Schema (APOS) theory, into a course. This study has adopted a framework to design creative learning materials and examined how this framework impacts students' creativity. This study used a pretest–posttest nonequivalent-groups design. The study investigated a STEM course which had 40 participants (n = 40, male = 11, female = 29) for 12 weeks. 6 weeks were spent using traditional teaching and 6 weeks integrating a CDIO framework into computational thinking. All the students in the course were college students with teacher college backgrounds. To examine the impact of our course, we used a questionnaire to examine the students’ creativity before and after the STEM course was applied. Our results show that our course had a significantly impact on our students’ creativity, particularly in the case of the male students.

"A Study on JP-Style STEAM Practices about 'Paper' for Early Childhood Education Focusing on the Sustainability Competencies","Haraguchi R.; Ohnuki A.; Shiihashi G.; Ishizawa J.","2024","9th International STEM Education Conference, iSTEM-Ed 2024 - Proceedings","0","Conference paper","EN","In Japan, interest in STEAM education, which adds an 'A' to STEM, has grown recently. The point of JP-style STEAM is that the 'A' is not limited to the arts but includes a broad range of liberal arts, such as life, economics, etc. The background to the interest in STEAM education is the international focus on sustainability competencies for realizing such as SDGs. Early childhood education in Japan has long been conducted as a well-rounded education. Thus, by reviewing its value, we may obtain essential clues regarding developing sustainability competencies that will be newly required for global early childhood education. This study examined four JP-style STEAM education practices about 'paper' for young children from the perspective of UNESCO's eight key competencies for sustainability [1]. As a result, it was found that though it is not explicitly shown in the Course of study for Kindergarten, learning about environmental issues, sustainability, ecology, ecosystems, etc., and support for developing sustainability competencies were already in place. On the other hand, however, these practices are still dependent on the competencies of individual early childhood educators, and it became clear that systematic curriculum building based on good practices and teacher training are issues to be addressed. © 2024 IEEE."

"The perceptions of prospective ICT teachers towards the integration of 3D printing into education and their views on the 3D modeling and printing course","Üçgül M.; Altıok S.","2023","Education and Information Technologies","11","Article","EN","3D printing technology has an influence on a variety of industries such as automotive, engineering, medical, aerospace, sports, fashion, education, and more. In education, 3D printing is used in many different fields like pharmacy, mathematics, biology, chemistry, art education, graphic design, engineering, and even in early childhood and special education. The adoption of 3D printing technology in education is still at a low level, and the lack of adequate technology education is considered a major obstacle to the adoption of this technology. As teachers’ knowledge of 3D printing technology increases, so will their intention to integrate 3D printing technologies into their classrooms. However, current teacher education programs have not provided sufficient training to trainees with the necessary expertise and skills to use digital fabrication in the classroom. This case study explored prospective information and communication technologies (ICT) teachers’ perceptions on the integration of 3D printing into teaching and learning as well as their evaluation of offered 3D modeling and printing course. The results showed that most of the prospective teachers were satisfied with the course and they felt competent enough about 3D printing processes and to integrate 3D printing in teaching-learning activities. They have positive opinions about the use of 3D printers for educational purposes, as they provide concretization of the subject, increase the motivation of the students, and they are very useful in the production of teaching materials. In line with the research results, suggestions were made for a course that aims to introduce 3D printing technologies in teacher education programs. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Infrastructural injustices in community-driven afterschool STEAM","Shea M.V.; Jurow A.S.; Schiffer J.; Escudé M.; Torres A.","2023","Journal of Research in Science Teaching","9","Article","EN","This article offers a qualitative analysis of infrastructural in/justice in a community-partnered design intervention focused on developing high-tech low-cost Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math (STEAM) projects. We examined the kinds of infrastructural injustices that were present in three afterschool programs and how it shaped STEAM education designs and opportunities for learning with technology to take hold. Combining insights and methods from studies of science and technology with Critical Race Theory, we developed the concept of infrastructural in/justice to illuminate the challenges of organizing STEAM for justice. Infrastructural injustices were identified at the level of dominant narratives that shaped the ideas, resources, and values that undergirded programming and pedagogical practices. We found that community educators were central to creating more just STEAM infrastructures. They drew out unjust infrastructural narratives, created counternarratives that allowed young people of color space to expand their technology and STEAM practices, and connected these practices to their everyday lives, identities, and emerging interests. We detail how working-class community educators of color are dreaming and enacting new ways to engage with STEAM and STEAM education alongside young people. As we have shown, their ideas and practices combined with the young people's visions for the future challenged neoliberal and racialized narratives of STEAM. Despite community educators' of color critical expertise, their jobs remained precarious within informal STEAM infrastructures. To design for and sustain more just community-driven STEAM activities we argue that the field must attend not only to how the work of infrastructuring to how community-driven STEAM is done but also by whom. These activities, organized by community educators of color, must be valued and protected through the classification systems within informal STEAM infrastructures in order to design and sustain more just community-driven STEAM initiatives. © 2023 National Association for Research in Science Teaching."

Design-based learning is an instructional approach that allows students to learn STEAM in more integrated ways than the traditional method. Using design thinking as a pedagogical framework, design-based learning engages students in designing solutions to real-life and human-centred problems. In this process, students must use creativity, visual arts, and design thinking as well as disciplinary knowledge and skills. Of great importance here is creative confidence–a belief in one’s own creative ability. However, research investigating the influence of design-based learning on students’ creative confidence is still scare. This mixed-methods study examined 31 eighth-grade students’ creative confidence before and after being challenged to design user-friendly tables. This design-based learning lasted for 12 50-minute periods that were scheduled over four weeks. We used a Likert-type questionnaire to collect quantitative data and recorded classroom discourse to gather qualitative data. Using non-parametric statistics, we found that the students significantly improved their creative confidence. Using a content analysis method, we identified crucial sources of this improvement and thus formed recommendations for how to foster students’ creative confidence within the context of design-based learning. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Implementing real construction site visits for education purposes faces challenges in getting access to proper construction sites and ensuring the safety of visiting students. This study combined the application of Project-based learning (PBL), game-based learning (GBL), and deeper learning theories to develop TheProjectLive ePlatform for students to experience virtual site tours. In this platform, 360-degree panoramas were utilized to present the approximate complexity of construction sites and provide an immersive learning environment. The study evaluated the effects of the proposed virtual site tour approach through two years of implementation in a tertiary course: Introductory Construction Technology and Materials. The students' knowledge acquisition and learning experience when applying the ePlatform were well measured through in-class quizzes and questionnaire surveys, respectively. Based on the descriptive and statistical sources of evidence, the developed ePlatform for conducting the virtual construction site tour demonstrated its potential to effectively improve students' transferable knowledge acquisition. The results of two in-class quizzes designed to assess students' comprehension of content knowledge and their competency to solve practical problems showed that the average scores of students who experienced the virtual site tour were higher than students who learned via lecture notes. Specifically, the average scores of the former were 13.3% and 17.8% higher than the latter in the two quizzes, respectively.

Even fewer have considered the important work that teachers carry out not just inside classrooms but beyond the classroom walls to sustain such STEAM implementation efforts, from interacting with administrators to recruiting students and persuading parents about the importance of arts and computer science. In order to understand teachers’ needs and practices regarding STEAM implementation, in this paper, we focus on eight experienced computer science teachers’ reflections on implementing a STEAM unit using electronic textiles, which combine crafting, circuit design, and coding so as to make wearable artifacts. We use a broad lens to examine the practices high school teachers employed not only in their classrooms but also in their schools and communities to keep these equitable learning opportunities going, from communicating with other teachers and admins to building a computer science (CS) teacher community across district and state lines. We also analyzed these reflections to understand teachers’ own social and emotional needs—needs important to staying in the field of CS education—better, as they are relevant to engaging with learning new content, applying new pedagogical skills, and obtaining materials and endorsements from their organizations to bring STEAM into their classrooms. In the discussion, we contemplate what teachers’ reported practices and needs say about supporting and sustaining equitable STEAM in classrooms. © 2023 by the authors."

In this sense, the integrated education of science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics (STEAM) is postulated as an educational approach through which to transform the teaching-learning processes into processes that contribute to the development of critical, creative, and scientific thinking. Proof of this is the continuous increase in publications in this line of research. This article presents a systematic review with a total of 19 studies published in high-impact journals with the aim of making a critical reflection and evaluating the real scope of incorporating STEAM projects in education to improve the students’ mathematical skills. In particular, five areas of interest have been evaluated: active learning in the teaching of STEAM subjects, the development of technological resources, the design and implementation of educational proposals, the evaluation of STEAM education and teacher training in STEAM education. Considering the results, we emphasize the need to continue working on the theoretical foundation and educational practice of this approach to allow teachers to implement it effectively. © (2024), (OmniaScience).

This program provides underrepresented youth, especially girls, with digital forensic knowledge, skills and career pathways, challenging them to explore complex social issues related to technology and to become cyber sleuths using real-world digital forensic methods and tools to solve investigative scenarios. Students also learn about related careers while improving their cyber street smarts. The CSSL incorporates additional “outside of the computer” activities to strengthen students’ engagement such as structured in-classroom discussions, mock trials, and in-person interactions with practitioner role models. The CSSL was piloted in various forms to assess the suitability for in-school and out-of-school settings, and the students predominantly represented racial minorities. Research in this project relied on a mixed methods approach for data collection and analysis,including qualitative and quantitative methods, reinforced using learning analytics generated from the students clicking through the interface and interacting with the system. Analysis of gathered data indicate that the virtual learning environment developed in this project is highly effective for teaching digital forensic knowledge, skills, and abilities that are directly applicable in the workplace. Furthermore, the strategies for gender inclusive STEM instruction implemented in CSSL are effective for engaging girls without being harmful to boys’ engagement. Learning STEM through digital forensic science taps into girls’ motivations to address real-world problems that have direct relevance to their lives, and to protect and serve their community. After participating in the educational program, girls expressed a significantly greater increase in interest, relative to boys, in learning more about careers related to digital forensics and cybersecurity. © 2023, The Author(s)."

It involves the disciplinary integration of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, as well as arts. Evaluation plays an essential role in assessing and improving the effectiveness of STE(A)M educational practices. Despite a broad range of research on evaluating the effectiveness of STE(A)M education, little work has been conducted on summarising and analysing the evaluation approaches. This paper addresses the research gap by examining the literature in relation to the evaluation of STE(A)M education in terms of its research types, evaluation objectives, data collection and analysis methods, and approaches. The study covers a total of 250 related research articles published between 2015 and 2022 which were collected form the Scopus database and analysed using a content analysis approach. The findings reveal that a majority of the articles are experimental and interventional in nature, with an emphasis on examining the effects of STE(A)M education as well as the attitudes and perceptions of stakeholders. The results also show the common use of descriptive statistics, t-tests, ANOVA, and regression as quantitative data analysis approaches, whereas thematic and content analysis were often adopted for qualitative data analysis.

This pedagogical approach addresses contemporary challenges by promoting transdisciplinary learning and problem-solving in real-world contexts. The integration of Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics (STEAM) enriches active learning methodologies and enhances students' understanding of scientific concepts. This paper examines the implementation of an active STEAM methodology in a learning environment that may be set as a classroom or implemented as a game. In whatever environment chosen, students take centre stage in their learning journey. Through this approach, students not only gain confidence and self-esteem but also develop autonomy in their learning process. Students are invited to dimension and plan to rebuild a city that was destroyed by some catastrophe. The planning activity is part of a game where the main aim is to acquire knowledge about integrals and their usage. As a result, we may infer that learning mathematics, mediated by digital technologies, allows the development of content in an effective and agile way for students. The increase in problem-solving, communication between peers, and the use of technological tools are competencies that may be evaluated during the execution of this activity. The students' motivation, learning, and development of soft and hard skills allowed us to realize that an integrated or interdisciplinary curriculum, as a pedagogical strategy like this, improves teaching quality and the learning process. © 2024 IEEE."

"THE ROLE OF STEAM EDUCATION IN IMPROVING STUDENT COLLABORATION AND CREATIVITY: A CASE STUDY IN MADRASAH","Zaqiah Q.Y.; Hasanah A.; Heryati Y.","2024","Jurnal Pendidikan Islam","0","Article","EN","The 21st century is marked by increasing technological progress and productivity. This progress has provided a challenge for the education sector to produce quality young people with adequate skills. This research examines the effectiveness of a learning approach that integrates a multi-subject called STEAM, namely science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics, to improve 21st-century skills. These skills include collaboration, creativity, critical thinking and communication, known as the 4Cs. As a case study, this STEAM learning was given to students at two State Madrasahs in West Java. To achieve this goal, mixed methods were used. The research combined qualitative and quantitative approaches. A qualitative approach was used to observe phenomena experienced by students, learning design, and implementation. Moreover, a quantitative approach was used to analyze the impact of STEAM learning on student skills. The STEAM learning design was delivered in three learning meetings. Research findings show that the STEAM learning model by using a multi-subject approach could significantly improve students' collaboration skills. However, it did not significantly improve students’ critical thinking, creativity and communication skills. Meanwhile, student responses showed positive results on the implementation of this model. Factors that were considered to influence the implementation of this model are: Duration of learning, literacy skills and student learning experiences, as well as teacher competencies. © 2024, Faculty of Tarbiya and Teacher Training UIN Sunan Gunung.

"Fostering Student Engagement and Success in STEM Education: An AI-Driven Exploration of High Impact Practices from Cross-Disciplinary General Education Courses","Ramasamy V.; Singsen D.; Walia G.S.","2024","Journal of Engineering Education Transformations","3","Article","EN","Due to the increase in data and software tools, the need for programmers and data analysts has risen in the United States during the 21st century. As a result, more students are enrolling in Computer Science, Information Technology, and Data Science programs nationwide. However, switching to online and blended learning and using cyberlearning tools have presented new challenges for student learning, retention, and program success. One way to overcome these challenges and improve student achievement is to implement evidence-based pedagogical strategies and innovative technologies within clear theoretical frameworks. Recent studies have shown that various Learning Engagement Strategies (LESs) in STEM education, such as gamification, active learning, feedback and assessment, and interactive multimedia, significantly increase student engagement and course completion rates. High-Impact Practices (HIPs), identified as crucial by Kuh in 2008, have become powerful tools for enhancing student involvement, retention, and completion in higher education. This article explores practices that can enhance student learning and success that have many benefits, including more robust relationships between students and faculty, cooperative learning, quick feedback, inclusive environments, and conflict resolution. The study uses NLP-based text analytics to investigate the application and impact of these High-Impact Practices (HIPs) across different disciplines. Firstly, it identifies the most prevalent HIPs in various General Education (Gen Ed) disciplines that impact student success. Secondly, it formulates AI-driven recommendations for cultivating a student-centric learning environment through HIPs within STEM education. The results of empirical analyses using course materials, survey data, syllabi, and pre/post-workshop surveys sourced from around 65 Gen Ed course at a small public university provides valuable insights into successful HIPs for STEM courses that can help instructors improve their online and blended course designs. By implementing these practices, educators can increase student engagement, retention, and completion rates across diverse student populations in Gen Ed STEM courses. © 2024 JEET."

"Towards a pedagogical conception of imagination in STEAM education","Decorte B.; Vlieghe J.","2024","Ethics and Education","0","Article","EN","STEAM is a coupling of the well-known STEM-disciplines of science, technology, engineering and mathematics with the arts. This conception of education builds on the foundations of STEM-curricula but complements it with a focus on innovation, creativity, novelty etc. Those in favor of STEAM education emphasize the importance of this shifted focus in better preparing the future generations for the complex challenges to come. However, a portion of the discourse on STEAM tends to reduce this approach to education to a means towards market-oriented ends. In opposition to such a discourse and primarily informed by Koestler’s work on imagination and discovery in science, art and other domains of human creativity, we develop and defend a pedagogical conception of imagination. By connecting this conception of pedagogical imagination to insights from Tyson Lewis and Peter Hyland, we propose a protocol-based educational practice which can be incorporated in STEAM education. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"A systematic literature review on STEAM pre- and in-service teacher education for sustainability: Are teachers ready?","Ariza J.Á.; Olatunde-Aiyedun T.G.","2024","Eurasia Journal of Mathematics, Science and Technology Education","0","Article","EN","Educational interest in sustainable development (SD) and sustainability has increased over the last fifteen years, promoted by international guidelines and agencies such as the UN or UNESCO, or the Incheon Declaration. While the current state-of-art discloses plenty of student-centered proposals in these fields, there is scarce evidence on how these are being addressed in pre- and in-service teacher education programs combining science, technology, engineering, arts, and math (STEAM). Searching to tackle this gap, we performed a systematic literature review based on 207 studies retrieved from the databases Scopus, WoS, and ERIC through PRISMA guidelines. The outcomes foremost reveal the following: (1) Pre-service programs lack courses or subjects that allow integrating sustainability and STEAM areas in an interdisciplinary approach. (2) Interventions for STEAM teacher education are focused on mathematics and statistics typically for the preservice stage only with a proposal for rural teachers. (3) In-service teachers manifest difficulties in linking theoretical concepts with real-world experiences in classrooms. And (4) educational strategies employ problem-based learning, inquiry-based learning, escape rooms, robotics, or flipped classrooms. The implications of this study can help researchers, teachers, or stakeholders in the co-design of initiatives or methodologies that improve pre- and in-service teacher education programs to cope with STEAM education, sustainability, and SD, highlighting the importance of the teachers’ role. © 2024 by the authors; licensee Modestum.

"Demonstrating Pedagogical Content Knowledge Through the Development of Educational Science Board Games","Botes W.","2024","European Journal of STEM Education","1","Article","EN","Preservice teachers who are specialising in the teaching of the subject natural science at a primary school level, ought to demonstrate the ability to present lessons that provoke a joyful yet meaningful educational experience amongst learners. One such approach that was taken, was when natural science preservice teachers were tasked with developing educational science board games as a means to enrich their teaching practice during a recent school visitation opportunity. However, given this educational exercise, what remains a mystery from a teacher development perspective is whether this exercise provoked some form of ‘pedagogical thinking’ among preservice teachers? It is with this question in mind, that the study investigated whether the task of developing educational science board games sparked the ability of preservice teachers to demonstrate knowledge of pedagogical content. The study draws on a modified understanding of Shulman’s pedagogical content knowledge model, which in the context of gamification requires one to effectively transmit ‘subject knowledge’ in an interactive manner through ‘educational board game practices and engagement’. Using a focus group discussion and photo-voice methodology as data collection techniques, this qualitative study uncovered how preservice teachers demonstrated i) knowledge of the curriculum, ii) knowledge of instructional strategies, iii) knowledge of learner-thinking, and iv) knowledge of assessment. This study holds a series of implications for future research in the field of initial teacher development and STEM education. For example, it will be interesting to uncover how preservice teachers experience the use of educational board games in their teaching. In addition, it will also be interesting to discover how educational board games can be used in other STEM subjects such as mathematics, technology, and physical science. Ultimately, more research is also required on the learning benefits of educational board games from a learner’s perspective. © 2024 by Author/s and Licensed by Lectito Publications, Netherlands."

"Promoting STEM Education through the Preparation of Multicultural National Robotics Teams in Qatar (Evaluation)","Katbeh T.; Cieslinski G.B.; Bazzi H.","2023","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings","1","Conference paper","EN","In recent years, university outreach programs have increased as an effective method of imparting a comprehensive perspective into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers and disciplines to school students. Different models of STEM education exist and the implementation of educational robotics to pre-college students has been deemed impactful in influencing the students' interest in STEM fields. This is due to the accessibility of educational robotics as well providing an engaging, hands-on method of combining technology, engineering, and design. Therefore, with the increase in educational robotics programs, having an end goal for the students is necessary for learning motivation. That is why involvement in international robotics competitions would meet this component. Moreover, combining the multicultural aspect that has been increasingly predominant in STEM helps raise the educational structure to a melting pot pedagogy. This provides a solid foundation for the students' development as they experience diversity consciousness even in a technical setting. This paper highlights the importance and the techniques behind joining groups of multicultural backgrounds in Qatar to represent national teams in international competitions - notably the well-renowned FIRST Global Challenge, an Olympics-style robotics competition that brings teams from different countries to solve the challenges facing our world. Preparing for the FIRST Global Challenge includes gaining effective communication and problem-solving skills as the students work as a team to devise creative solutions to real-world engineering problems. The approach with which the students representing two different nations - Afghanistan and Qatar - were trained in a shared workspace will be presented. Qatar is known for its cultural diversity, and the schools across Qatar include students from over 100 nationalities. Therefore, determining a technique to be delivered to a multicultural environment is essential to the learning process involved.

"Towards competencies and methods to support Responsible Research and Innovation within STEAM secondary education–the case of Spain","Malagrida R.; Klaassen P.; Ruiz-Mallén I.; Broerse J.E.W.","2024","Research in Science and Technological Education","4","Article","EN","Introduction: Under the label of ‘Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI)’, increasing efforts have been made over the past decade to make research and innovation (R&I) more open and inclusive to improve the way we solve today’s complex challenges. However, no commonly accepted norms or standards on the practical implementation of RRI currently exist. One of today’s challenges is how to facilitate its implementation within science education. This article aims to contribute to the necessary conceptual and practical grounding of RRI in STEAM (science, technology, engineering, the arts and mathematics) education by developing a framework of RRI competencies and by gaining insight into secondary school STEAM educators’ practices and perspectives on teaching RRI competencies. It adds to an emerging research field in which science education contributes to solving real-world problems by focusing on competencies needed to participate in RRI processes.  Methodology: After developing a Comprehensive Framework of RRI Competencies in STEAM education, we engaged secondary school teachers (n=40) involved in innovation within the education project Xplore Health (XH). Participants were recruited through purposive and homogenous sampling from three cities in Spain (Barcelona, Granada and A Coruña). Through one focus group in each city, we analysed teachers’ perspectives on how well RRI competencies in the Framework were covered using the XH’s educational resources and on how that coverage could be improved. Results: The results show that teachers encounter important limitations in addressing competencies within all the RRI process requirements: reflexivity, anticipation, inclusion and responsiveness. They suggested learning methods and actions for improving that coverage in secondary STEAM education. Discussion and conclusions: We conclude that the Comprehensive Framework of RRI Competencies helps teachers reflect on how to innovate in STEAM education and that Community-Based Participatory Research facilitates the development of most of the competencies teachers considered difficult to apply with the other approaches. © 2022 The Author(s).

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, online board game activities were incorporated into the teaching mode of the course. Game-based learning and game mechanics were integrated into the learning activities of the course. The learning activities incorporated a cardboard game with digital media and a competitive mode to enhance the interest of students with design expertise in STEM topics. The basic concepts of programming language were transformed into images and the game mechanism was added to enhance students' motivation. In this study, students were introduced to the basic structure of programming through a specially designed board game to enhance their logical thinking skills. We found that the transformation of program concepts from words to images helped learners to make picture associations, which effectively increased motivation and motivated learners to participate in learning. Especially for students who were not interested in STEM. © 2023 Author(s)."
"The Development of STEAM Workshop with PET Bottles Upcycling and Computer-Aided Design","Ng C.H.; Shih Y.-T.","2024","Computer-Aided Design and Applications","0","Article","EN","Many PET bottles were used every day. Although being designed to be single use, the durability of these plastic bottles enables possibilities for other purposes. However, many of these still-usable used bottles were being transferred into rubbish bins and landfills. Not only does it waste the potential, but these plastic bottles also pollute the environment. Before taking 450 years to decompose, these bottles can be upcycled for better use. Considering the high accessibility, possibilities in functions and creative expressions, PET bottles can be excellent teaching material for STEAM education. This article provides a guideline for teachers on a STEAM education curriculum in upcycling plastic bottles. By studying the bottles and the plastics material, observing, and identifying their design problem and utilizing CAD software and 3D printers to create their prototype, students may master design thinking, problem-solving skills, and 3D modelling skills. With a workshop being conducted, successful attempts in student upcycling projects can be seen. © 2024 U-turn Press LLC,."
"Success Framework for a STEAM x S-L Partnership","Grahame K.S.; Shea A.E.; Amstutz C.","2023","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings","0","Conference paper","EN","It is widely recognized that there is a need for a diverse workforce of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) professionals, leaders, and innovators to co-create successful solutions for global problems. The inclusion of art into STEM activities (making STEAM the new acronym) has the potential to encourage a more diverse population of learners to become engaged in this workforce. While these needs are great, there is not widespread access to STEAM activities; teachers in many districts face multiple constraints in developing new rigorous activities. Partnerships between K-12 and universities can ease this burden through service learning (S-L). At an urban elementary school in the northeast, an afterschool STEAM club has been partnering with a S-L engineering course from a local university to develop and facilitate activities. We call this partnership STEAM x S-L. This partnership seeks to be mutually beneficial and work towards a common goal developed by the community partner and university, to achieve a transformative relationship. Our partnership specifically focuses on engaging and growing K-12 STEAM education in a manner that does not place the burden solely on K-12 teachers. Utilizing a design-based implementation research approach, the school and university teams created numerous collaborative activities for upper elementary-aged students. The process of improving activities occurred through iterative interviews, student work samples, and feedback from the K-12 students and undergraduate team leaders. The results from this iterative process were then used to develop an initial framework for what makes successful activities for the STEAM x S-L partnership. The framework was then mapped to current literature around developmentally appropriate teaching practices, STEAM, and S-L and further refined through comparison to student feedback on various activities. This framework has implications for both researchers studying S-L and STEAM education and also practitioners seeking to set up their programs for success. While elementary teachers are overworked and over-asked, developing S-L relationships with local university programs can be one solution to addressing STEAM workforce development at both K-12 and university levels. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2023."

"Engineering design learning for high school and college first-year students in a STEM battlebot design project","Chien Y.-H.; Liu C.-Y.; Chan S.-C.; Chang Y.-S.","2023","International Journal of STEM Education","6","Article","EN","Background: There is a worldwide trend to include engineering design in high school curricula as a bridge course to higher-level STEM education and to increase high school students’ interest in STEM fields. This study used a battlebot design curriculum to compare engineering design learning between high school and college first-year students and then proposed suggestions for curriculum planning that promoted the continuity of learning between different levels of engineering design education. Results: This study used the creative product analysis matrix (CPAM) and lag sequential analysis (LSA) to explore the possible similarities and differences between the two groups’ understanding of engineering design. The results show that college first-year students were significantly better than high school students in CPAM, but the two groups were similar in their reflections on engineering design behaviors, indicating that the noncumulative learning results must be taken seriously. Conclusions: Higher-order engineering design thinking skills take a longer time to develop than technical skills. For both high school and college first-year students, it is important to enhance their higher-order engineering design thinking skills to promote higher engineering design performance. Moreover, high school students could be provided with convenient processing tools and easy-to-use, hands-on techniques to increase their technical skills. Educators from institutions of higher education and K-12 schools should work together to develop pedagogical models that provide rigorous, well-rounded education and outstanding engineering design instructions to most effectively cultivate STEM talent. © 2023, The Author(s)."
"Constructing and storytelling: accommodating different play orientations in learning spatial thinking","Sonneveld L.; Klapwijk R.M.; Stappers P.J.","2024","Frontiers in Education","1","Article","EN","Spatial ability is malleable and belongs in the preschool. For preschoolers, many analytical activities with one correct answer such as tangram have been developed. Less is known about employing open-ended design assignments to creatively practice spatial thinking. Little attention has been paid to the mutual qualitative differences between children when engaged in spatial thinking and insight in children’s motivation is lacking. As design and play have much in common, our first study investigated play orientations during free play of 49 Dutch preschoolers during free play in a low and a high SES school. Participative interviews and observations in the construction and home corners of two schools uncovered different play orientations– construction and pretend play - and either a focus on open-ended objects or on defined objects. In a subsequent study, the influence of these play and object orientations on how children design was investigated. This study with 13 children also used generative design research methods grounded in ethnographic research and therapeutic practices. Using an empathic, story-based, open-ended design challenge, results showed that play-orientations of children influence the length and nature of the design activities as well as the design outcomes. Children with a pretend-play orientation are longer engaged and talk more about the character involved. They usually built organic structures with a variety of objects, while construction-oriented children mainly built sturdy and geometrical structures and mainly used open-ended objects. In all play orientations, spatial thinking was practiced and children were spatially challenged. For example, in all orientations difficulties arose around getting the character in out the structure, however, as different structures were build, the nature of these difficulties were also different. Open-ended design activities that contain characters and problems children can empathize with are a valuable addition to the palette of activities to develop spatial thinking in early classrooms. Our study shows that design activities stimulate children to practice spatial thinking in a creative context and have the ability to engage children with a pretend-play orientation who are otherwise less engaged in construction. The play-orientations and object-orientations are informative for research and the development of spatial educational interventions aiming at a diversity of learners.

Although eco-innovation has been broadly applied in different industries, such as low-carbon production and manufacturing, how to implement such innovation in education for sustainable development (ESD) has rarely been studied. Therefore, this research considered a reflective and cooperative learning approach to science, technology, engineering, arts, and math (STEAM) education. A case study examined Wanluan Township of Pingtung County in southern Taiwan. Four departments’ students and lecturers at Meiho University were involved in situated learning. Hospitality management students played farm owners who engaged in organic agriculture to produce food and beverages. These agricultural products were farm-to-table, cooked, and served to customers in a natural dining setting through the students’ teamwork. Tourism, sports and leisure management, and food science and nutrition students played tourists in a self-guided travel context, who engaged in acts such as visiting buildings to understand heritage while observing that the houses were still in use as dwellings. This encouraged reflection on the importance of cultural preservation. The results showed that eco-innovation can represent a sustainable marketing strategy for improving the local community economy and can be implemented in a practical situation in STEAM.

While STEAM-specific activities are fundamental to early childhood education, the concept of “STEAM” is not yet well known among preschool teachers. Teachers recognize the need to introduce children to new technologies, support their creativity, draw their attention to the environment, and promote its preservation for future generations. However, they face challenges in integrating engineering and technology into their teaching, particularly in relation to sustainable development goals. This chapter aims to address this issue by providing insights into preschool teachers’ views and practices regarding STEAM education, with a specific focus on engineering, technology, and sustainable development challenges. The latter is of particular interest because, despite the evidence that implementing STEAM could promote educational equality, there is still the perception that technology and engineering are unnecessary for girls. Given the potential influence of such biases on the future choices of children, it is imperative to address them through teacher training. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Weipeng Yang, Sarika Kewalramani and Jyoti Senthil; individual chapters, the contributors."

"A Novel Methodology to Develop STEAM Projects According to National Curricula","Montés N.; Zapatera A.; Ruiz F.; Zuccato L.; Rainero S.; Zanetti A.; Gallon K.; Pacheco G.; Mancuso A.; Kofteros A.; Marathefti M.","2023","Education Sciences","8","Article","EN","The objective of this work is the elaboration of a methodology to develop STEAM projects (Science (S), Technology (T), Engineering (E), Art (A) and Mathematics (M)). The methodology proposed in this article is part of the results of the project ERASMUS+DART4City (2020-1-ES01-KA227-SCH-095545) “Empowering Arts and creativity for the cities of tomorrow”, whose objective is to design a methodology in order to develop STEAM projects from European curricula. The proposed methodology emerges after analysing, among others, the curricula from Spain, Italy, Cyprus, France, Finland and Germany, taking into account the international perspective of STEAM education, their priorities and problems. The proposal has two variants: “forward” and “backward”. Both variants begin with the analysis of the curriculum in which the contents are grouped by similarity, classified according to STEAM disciplines so that the thematic areas can be obtained. Subsequently, in the “forward” variant, the thematic areas with most connections are selected as areas of opportunity; for the development of the STEAM project, so from the “forward” methodology, the teacher will be able to select an area of opportunity and develop the project around it, so, the concept or project idea comes from an area of oportunity. The “backward” variant starts from a concept considered interesting for society or just for the teacher and which will become the main theme of the STEAM project and, from that concept, we will select the thematic areas of the curriculum that can be included in the project. The main difference bewteen both methodologies is that in the “forward” variant, the STEAM project concept comes from an area of oportunity detected in the curriculum meanwhile in the “backward” variant the concept of the STEAM project comes from the teacher, without taking into acount, initially, the curriculum. This article shows an example of application of each variant. From the “forward” variant, the STEAM project “Sustainable City” is shown for years 4, 5 and 6 of Primary Education, which has been carried out from the opportunity area “Sustainability”. From the “backward” variant, we develop the STEAM project, whose main theme is cooking, in which, based on this theme, 10 tests are developed, each of them related to different thematic areas of the ES curriculum. © 2023 by the authors."
"Using Analogue Game Mechanics to Reduce Gender Inequality and Exclusion in Technology Education","Mattsson S.; Palmquist A.; Ulvenblad P.","2023","Handbook of Research on Implementing Inclusive Educational Models and Technologies for Equity and Diversity","0","Book chapter","EN","Technology education has traditionally been male dominated, and many educator providers struggle to both attract and keep females related to education. Gamification, the use of game elements in a nongame context, has been shown to increase student engagement and inclusion in the learning environment. However, the gamification design and development process has been declared resource-demanding, which has reduced the more tailored approaches resulting in more generic ones. This is contradictory to the findings that gamification designs, especially in instruction, are context dependent. Therefore, this chapter displays an analogue gamification approach that is applied in a real-life environment, a technology vocational school, supporting the teachers’ combat of gender inequality and expediting diversity and inclusion. © 2023 by IGI Global.

"SCRATCH to R: Toward an Inclusive Pedagogy in Teaching Coding","Liao S.-M.","2023","Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education","9","Article","EN","SCRATCH, developed by the Media Lab at MIT, is a kid-friendly visual programming language, designed to introduce programming to children and teens in a “more thinkable, more meaningful, and more social” way. Although it was initially intended for K-12 students, educators have used it for higher education as well, and found it particularly helpful for those who haven’t had the privilege of learning coding before college. In this article, we propose using SCRATCH to create an interactive and fun project for introduction as a gateway to learn R in introductory or intermediate statistics courses. We begin with a literature review on recent K-12 computing education, as well as how visual coding has been used in college classrooms as an aid for teaching syntax-based coding. Then, we explain the design of the proposed project and share the observations from a pilot study in a liberal arts college with 39 students who had diverse coding experiences. We find that the most disadvantaged students are not those with no coding experience, but those with poor prior coding experience or with low coding self-efficacy. This innovative SCRATCH-to-R approach also offers us a pathway toward an inclusive pedagogy in teaching coding. © 2022 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

"Understanding teachers' cross-disciplinary collaboration for STEAM education: Building a digital community of practice","Wu Z.","2022","Thinking Skills and Creativity","13","Article","EN","While creativity was previously considered a specialised ability, over the last 20 years creativity has been reframed as an open set of creative thinking skills and knowledge practices that all teachers can develop through a cross-disciplinary pedagogical approach. STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) has emerged as a cross-disciplinary learning model which explicitly aims to develop creative thinking skills across and through the disciplines. However, teachers’ lack of tacit knowledge in cross-disciplinary collaboration has created challenges and made it hard to implement STEAM in schools. Inspired by the approach of knowledge management, also known as Community of Practice (CoP), and how industries facilitate tacit knowledge propagation across departments to promote creativity through digital support, this article investigates how a Digital-CoP system may potentially support teachers’ cross-disciplinary collaboration. This paper prototypes a Digital CoP System for real world teachers to evaluate. It uses a mixed methods approach to understand teachers’ cross-disciplinary collaboration perception through a Digital-CoP System from the knowledge propagation perspective and points out the further enhancement of the Digital-CoP System enabling it to promote teachers' cross-disciplinary collaboration across Arts and STEM. © 2022"

These applications illustrate the capabilities and impact of AI and demonstrate that the educational system should invest in this technology and motivate students to learn about artificial intelligence and its applications; however, there is a need to make this technology understandable and enjoyable for the new generation. Currently, the topic of AI does not appear in most STEM curriculums not only because of the necessary technological infrastructure but also because of the required mathematical background. This paper is an attempt to develop AI in the STEM education framework through interactive activities. Our project titled 'Adventure Alongside AI' or 'A3I' analyzes the actions of students and reacts with sounds and visuals to illustrate the basic capabilities of AI. The developed platform could target different age groups of students: for younger students, this activity would serve as a motivational tool to discuss AI, and for older students, this activity would serve as an introduction into basic AI development and implementation. Our design platform aims to build upon existing educational constructs by combining the topics of AI and STEM education with gamification. Through this integration, educators can introduce new ways of creative problem-solving using enjoyable, interactive activities with AI. We assessed the design platform with a group of students through a survey that gauged their understanding of the AI embedded in the 'A3I' game activity; the results showed that the majority of students are interested in using this technology more in their classroom. © 2023 IEEE."
"Changes in Craft Education: A Case Study of General Education in Latvia","Urdziņa-Deruma M.","2023","FormAkademisk","0","Article","EN","In Latvia, the aim, content, and name of the subject of craft education have changed several times. The most recent transformation to “craft education” has been made following the general education reform, which has been gradually implemented since 2020. This study aims to investigate how the purpose and content of craft learning in Latvian comprehensive schools have changed as a result of this reform in comparison to the previous period. A qualitative study was carried out by analysing normative documents and interviewing design and technology teachers (N = 9) with at least 10 years of experience. The document analysis shows that the goal of teaching craft education has shifted from using craft as an opportunity to improve the quality of the living environment through creative involvement in techniques to producing valuable objects for oneself and society through the design process. The most significant change in the content is that craft is taught through the design process. Moreover, every pupil learns all the techniques; previously, students chose textile or woodwork and metalwork techniques from grade 5. According to the interviews, the skills acquired in each technique are at a lower level compared to the previous period, as the number of hours allocated to each technique does not allow pupils to pay in-depth attention to the tasks. The products made by the students have also become more straightforward. Finally, more time is spent on idea generation, planning, and evaluation. © 2023, The Assosiation FormAkademisk.

"Directions for inquiry-based teaching in China's new educational era","He J.; Goto K.","2023","New Perspectives in Science Education - International Conference","0","Book chapter","EN","This time, the inquiry-based education that China's new compulsory curriculum standards aim to provide was investigated mainly through a literature review. On 21 April 2022, the Ministry of Education of China announced new compulsory education curriculum standards. In order to solve this situation, the new curriculum standards aim to deepen the reform of basic education and, at the same time, to enable students to grow healthily and happily, and to cultivate human resources with the three qualities required by the State: ideals, skills and responsibility. Three major changes can be seen in this course revision: the focus on key competencies, the emphasis on course synthesis and the practical nurture person. China has recognized the importance of education beyond knowledge learning for several years. In 2020, Shanghai promulgated the Compulsory Education Project-based Teaching Three-Year Plan (2020-2022), which focused on the practice and research of project-based teaching, aiming at creative problem-solving skills, and promoted it in schools across Shanghai. In addition, the Practical Exploratory Discussion on the New Curriculum Standards for Compulsory Education, held on 14 August, stated that the creation of lessons based on the new curriculum standards will require new lesson designs, re-organization of knowledge, curriculum redesign and educational design for students' independent learning. Thus, in the revision, China's desire to cultivate more holistic students, not only those who know only 'knowledge and skills', can be seen. However, at present, there are many difficulties in implementing enquiry-based education in China. According to Ou (2004), first, there has been no such thing as 'student-led lesson design' in CHeducation. Therefore, most of the inquiry-based education up to now has been a class in which students try to solve problems by teachers continuously giving hints that lead to the solution of certain problems, and there were not many situations in which students were able to think. In addition, there is a lot of dissatisfaction with inquiry-based education in the field because teachers do not understand the concept of 'inquiry', do not know what is needed to conduct an inquiry class, and do not understand its meaning. © 2023, Pixel Associazione.

"The effects of art design courses in higher vocational colleges based on C-STEAM","Qian C.; Ye J.-H.; Lee Y.-S.","2022","Frontiers in Psychology","3","Article","EN","C-STEAM education is aimed at preserving local culture, while also improving students’ interests and skills in science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics-related fields. Other goals are to cultivate students to solve complex and practical problems through interdisciplinary thinking or integrate learning subjects with local senses in the context. In the present curriculum implemented in China, STEAM education mainly focuses on K-12 education and kindergarten education, and it is not widely implemented in colleges and universities, and most of the existing courses are carried out in general technical courses such as robotics and 3D printing, and less in design courses, since the concept of STEAM education has just begun to be advocated recently. Nevertheless, STEAM courses are still limited to special educational systems and disciplines, even though these courses have been vigorously promoted in China. Thus, this study designed an innovative higher vocational college curriculum based on the interdisciplinary principle of C-STEAM, using art design as a meta-theme framework and integrating CHlocal culture. A single-subject quasi-experimental design method was used. A total of 45 students majoring in art design in a higher vocational college were invited to participate in this study. The teaching experiment lasted for 9 weeks. Through teachers’ teaching and, demonstration and students’ independent learning of C-STEAM knowledge in the field of art and design, the concept of C-STEAM was introduced to the creation of packaging design. At the same time, a model composed of six hypotheses was constructed, using the creative self-efficacy scale, learning engagement scale, and creative performance assessment as measurement methods, to discuss students’ participation in the art and design courses of higher vocational colleges based on the concept of C-STEAM integration of creative self-efficacy, learning engagement, and creative performance over time. The results showed that students with higher creative self-efficacy had higher learning engagement (cognitive, affective, and behavioral), and students with higher learning engagement performed better in terms of creative performance. The results of this study can help researchers and educators to focus on C-STEAM courses and provide suggestions for the cultivation of art and design professionals in higher vocational colleges.

"The exploration of continuous learning intention in STEAM education through attitude, motivation, and cognitive load","Wu C.-H.; Liu C.-H.; Huang Y.-M.","2022","International Journal of STEM Education","50","Article","EN","Background: This study proposes a learning cycle and a comprehensive research framework that integrates Bloom’s taxonomy: the cognitive domain (cognitive load), affective domain (attitude and motivation) and psychomotor domain (implementation of science, technology, engineering, arts, and math [STEAM] activities) to explore the relationship between these learning domains and learning intention. The proposed innovative mediated-moderation model includes second-order factors derived from the technology acceptance model (TAM) (perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived enjoyment), the attention, relevance, confidence and satisfaction (ARCS) model, and cognitive load (mental load and mental effort) to explain the continuous learning intention of STEAM education. Results: A teaching material was designed for the STEAM activity, and an empirical experiment was subsequently conducted. The empirical experiment of STEAM activities with our design teaching material (micro:bit with artificial intelligence-based concept) was conducted at a university and an elementary school; a total of 145 questionnaire survey data were collected after the activities. University student participants were 20–24 years old and the elementary school student participants were at the K5–K6 level. The results showed that perceived usability directly influenced learning intention and strengthened the relationship between learning attitudes and intention. The ARCS plays a critical moderating role that positively influenced perceived usability and strengthened its effects on learning attitudes. Regarding the mediating effects, cognitive load negatively influenced perceived usability.

"Community Embedded Computing Education: Shaping Young People's Perceptions of Self-confidence and Personal Expression with Computer Science in a Youth Boxing Gym","Lachney M.; Yadav A.; Drazin M.; Green B.","2023","SIGCSE 2023 - Proceedings of the 54th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education","4","Conference paper","EN","Efforts in the United States to broaden the participation of racial and ethnic minorities in K12 computer science (CS) education often focus on the need for children to change themselves to meet the standards and norms of traditional computing education. Less attention has been paid to how CS education itself might change and adapt to cultural contexts and locations that children already participate in and find of value. In this paper, we describe efforts to change the shape and culture of CS education by designing and implementing it in and for a youth boxing gym in an African American community. We report findings from a boxing inspired CS curriculum that was designed in collaboration with boxing coaches, mentors, and academic staff members at the gym. It was piloted over the course of two six-hour workshops with 15 middle and high school age children. We focused on two issues that are relevant to broadening participation and reshaping the culture of CS education: (1) how the curriculum changed children's perceptions of CS and (2) the creative adaptations that children made to the curricular content and materials. An analysis of pre- and post-surveys using a nonparametric test showed significant positive changes in children's responses to the constructs of self-confidence and expression with CS. Vignettes of children appropriating and personalizing technologies from the workshops are used to unpack these findings. We end with a discussion about the implications of these findings for culture-based CS education in both school and community contexts. © 2023 ACM."

"Integration of Shangshan culture into the STEAM curriculum and teaching: results of an interview-based study","Qian C.; Ye J.-H.; Zheng C.","2023","Frontiers in Psychology","0","Article","EN","Introduction: Interdisciplinary science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) courses are a popular trend in international education than can help inculcate creativity in students. Although STEAM courses have been widely promoted in China, they are generally unsustainable because they are merely imitations of European and American courses and lack CHhumanistic factors; a close integration between disciplinary ideas and thinking levels is also lacking. C-STEAM, which is designed to pass down China’s culture, is a form of STEAM education with local CHcharacteristics that are focused on integrating interdisciplinary knowledge with the thought process oriented toward cultural heritage. Methods: In this study, an innovative higher vocational college course with C-STEAM interdisciplinary principles was constructed, with art and design as the framework, and with the integration of CHlocal culture. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to sample 12 learners from a total of 90 students in the experimental class of the C-STEAM course. The study aimed to provide a deeper understanding of the effectiveness of taking a Packaging Design course combined with C-STEAM from multiple perspectives. After the interviews, based on the BAO model, coding statistics and thematic analysis were conducted to understand the learners’ beliefs, actions, and outcomes after taking the course, and their plans for acquiring C-STEAM interdisciplinary knowledge and learning CHlocal culture. Results: The integration of the Shangshan culture (上山文化) into the Packaging Design course proved the importance and significance of adding C-STEAM to the art design course, which helped us understand the specific feelings of students after completing the course and gain a deeper understanding of the changes in their knowledge and skills and their learning effects. Discussion: Integrating C-STEAM education into courses related to art and design is highly warranted to encourage students to apply their interdisciplinary knowledge to artistic exploration and creation. Moreover, to effectively develop a curriculum system with local characteristics, teachers should provide more opportunities for students to explore and learn C-STEAM in the future, and integrate multiple elements into their teaching. In general, a cultural perspective-based interdisciplinary education helps facilitate the creative transformation of traditional CHculture. Copyright © 2023 Qian, Ye and Zheng."

"Design strategies to integrate creative learning in elementary school curricula through computer programming activities","Murai Y.; Ikejiri R.; Yamauchi Y.; Tanaka A.; Nakano S.","2023","Interactive Learning Environments","5","Article","EN","Cultivating children’s creativity and imagination is fundamental to preparing them for an increasingly complex and uncertain future. Engaging in creative learning enables children to think independently and critically, work cooperatively, and take risks while actively engaged in meaningful projects. While current trends in education, such as maker movements and computer science education, are dramatically expanding children’s opportunities for engagement in creative learning, comparatively few empirical studies explore how creative learning can be integrated into elementary school curricula. In this paper, we investigated five key design strategies for integrating creative learning in school curricula through computer programming activities. The five design strategies, drawn from design meetings with in-service teachers and two pilot studies, comprise (1) prepare an object-to-think-with for specific curricular ideas, (2) find a context that provokes a leap of ideas within a disciplinary framework, (3) facilitate tinkering through disciplinary inquiry, (4) pair students and establishing developer and researcher roles, and (5) provide feedback to connect computer programming projects to disciplinary ideas. Implementing these strategies with mixed-method analysis indicated positive support for the efficacy of these design strategies. We also provide insights into difficulties with integrating creative learning into school curricula. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

"Technology in Nature—mDGBL as a Successful Approach to Promote Complex Contents?","Bengel P.T.; Peter C.","2023","Sustainability (Switzerland)","2","Article","EN","The central challenges of our time mostly share a high level of complexity, which makes them unsolvable by single-perspective approaches. To offer adolescents the educational concepts that enable them to take various perspectives, comprehend, and finally deal constructively with these problems, innovative measures must be created. Additionally, the benefit of these measures must be shared equally by all learners, without being limited by their individual biographical or attitudinal characteristics. In this work, potential concepts were collected from geography education, technology education (TE), and education for sustainable development (ESD), and merged into a multi-perspective educational approach with mobile digital game-based learning (mDGBL) for the promotion of environmental and technology-related content. In the presented study, the accumulation of n = 94 Hessian students’ subject-specific knowledge (SSK) was evaluated in a comparative study with a control group, along with the potential influence of gender, age, and concept-related attitudes (CRA) in a longitudinal quantitative study. Firstly, in a study of this kind, in addition to the approach’s short-term success, the long-term effects on subject-specific knowledge were also tested. The results prove the full success of the innovative mDGBL intervention. There were strong immediate and long-lasting effects on participants’ SSK, measured right after and eight weeks after the intervention. It could be proven that, although there were partially significant gender differences in attitudes towards modern technologies, learning success was not influenced by gender, age, or any of the measured attitudinal dimensions. © 2022 by the authors."
"Game design and didactic transposition of knowledge. The case of progo, a game dedicated to learning object-oriented programming","Djelil F.; Sanchez E.","2023","Education and Information Technologies","6","Article","EN","Game based-learning have been widely promoted to overcome the difficulties encountered by beginners to learn programming. However, there are many issues to address for the implementation of game-based learning. Indeed, game-based learning is not limited to adding game elements such as rewards to a learning situation, but it rather consists of transforming the learning situation so that it becomes playful. This work contributes to computer science education research, especially to game design for learning programming. We design a novel environment dedicated to learning object-oriented programming for beginners called Progo. It is based on a metaphor of a three-dimensional (3D) construction and animation game. We present an a priori analysis of the Progo environment on the basis of a didactic transposition framework. The framework highlights the ludicisation and metaphorisation process by which educational content is integrated into the game. This allows for the analysis of the transformation of the computing knowledge by the game design, and to verify whether analogies are maintained between the knowledge and what the learner should experience through play. This work contributes to a framework for the integration of educational content during learning game design. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

The results show that, despite a lack of consensus on a common definition, a core set of key CT skills is addressed in primary and lower secondary education. Implementation approaches that emerged from the analysis are discussed and presented according to the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (2016) classification: (i) embedding CT across the curriculum as a transversal theme/skill set; (ii) integrating CT as a separate subject; and (iii) incorporating CT skills within other subjects such as Mathematics and Technology. New approaches to formative assessment of CT are emerging, reflecting different conceptualisations and differences in contextual and motivational aspects of CT curriculum integration.

"The eLuna mixed-reality visual language for co-design of narrative game-based learning trails","Breien F.; Wasson B.; Greiff S.; Hauan N.P.","2022","Frontiers in Education","2","Article","EN","Increased focus on out-of-school learning has led to extended use of Science Centers as learning arenas for junior and high school students in formal learning situations. The creation of learning trails, semantic collections of science center exhibits based on formal learning plans for interdisciplinary STEAM education, has become an area of focus. Previous design research has resulted in the definition of story-driven learning trails that foster flow and engagement in learners. In science centers, equal emphasis is placed on the physical real-world domain, represented by the exhibits themselves, as the virtual components, represented as collaborative positions-based portables carried between exhibits, linking the exhibits into virtual storylines using sensors and control assignments. This defines science center learning trails as mixed reality systems; holistic systems that integrate real and virtual elements, existing on the axis between real and virtual poles on the reality–virtuality continuum. Research has shown that a set of characteristics of narrative game-based learning has positive effects on engagement, motivation, and learning. The eLuna Framework comprises a co-design method and a visual language that emphasizes these characteristics, and that supports educators and game developers to co-specify blueprints of screen-based narrative learning game experiences. Applying thematic analysis and heuristic usability methods to interview data from two design studies completed by six science center educators based on a STEAM enabled exhibit cluster at the Bergen Science Centre VilVite, this research extends the eLuna Visual Language to distinguish between real and virtual elements for the eLuna Framework to achieve its full potential to co-design and co-specify science center mixed reality narrative game-based learning trails. The resulting extension can be plugged into the eLuna method and applied in future co-design and co-specification of mixed-reality narrative game-based learning trails which promote flow in learners, and affords positive effects on engagement, motivation, and learning.

The STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) disciplines have emerged as pivotal in facilitating the acquisition of these skills. Indeed, these disciplines have exhibited their capacity to enhance workforce performance and fortify a nation's innovation potential, emphasizing the critical need to promote STEAM education among students and integrate it into existing educational curricula. Nonetheless, the inclusion of students with intellectual or developmental disabilities (IDD) in these disciplines presents formidable challenges. These challenges can be attributed to prevailing low expectations regarding the potential of disabled individuals to excel in STEAM fields, the inaccessibility of STEAM education curricula, and the limitations that educators face in fully supporting the integration of students with disabilities. In response to these challenges, we introduce the RoboSTEAMSEN project. The principal objective of the RoboSTEAMSEN project is to bolster educational processes by equipping teachers working with students with IDD with methodologies and tools that employ Robotics and Active Learning Methodologies to promote STEAM education. The project's overarching goals encompass comprehending the specific needs of disabled students and adapting robotics and active learning techniques to accommodate various disabilities, designing comprehensive training programs for teachers to enable them to individualize the learning experiences of students with IDD, establishing a community of practice supported by a technological ecosystem that serves as a central hub for educators and decision-makers to engage in discourse on how to achieve success in STEAM education for IDD students. The primary outcome of this project will be the enhancement of STEAM education for students with IDD.

"Toward a Praxis-Oriented Understanding of Student Self-Assessment in STEAM Education: How Exemplary Educators Leverage Self-Assessment","Rickey N.; Dubek M.; DeLuca C.","2023","Cambridge Journal of Education","0","Article","EN","While researchers have begun to develop theories of assessment to support integrated learning within Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics (STEAM) education, the role of student self-assessment (SSA)–a core aspect of classroom assessment–has been understudied. The purpose of this research was to develop an initial praxis-oriented understanding of how exemplary STEAM educators provoke SSA in integrated learning. Through an in-depth qualitative methodology drawing on interview and artefact data from 14 purposefully selected exemplary STEAM teachers, this study identified seven types of SSA activities: (a) self-documentation of learning; (b) reflection; (c) making metacognitive processes explicit; (d) prototype testing and revision; (e) goal setting; (f) self-testing; and (g) interactional SSA. Superimposed on the engineering design process, a process commonly leveraged to integrate disciplines in STEAM education, results provide a nuanced understanding of how exemplary STEAM educators leverage SSA, advancing assessment theory and practice in integrated education. ©, University of Cambridge, Faculty of Education."
"A primer on gamification standardization","de Queiros R.A.P.; Pinto M.; Simões A.; Portela C.F.","2022","Research Anthology on Game Design, Development, Usage, and Social Impact","6","Book chapter","EN","Computer science education has always been a challenging topic for both sides of the trench: educators and learners. Nowadays, with the pandemic state that we are facing, these challenges are even greater, leading educators to look for strategies that promote effective virtual learning. One of such strategies includes the use of game mechanics to improve student engagement and motivation. This design strategy is typically called gamification. Nowadays, gamification is being seen as the solution to solve most of the issues related to demotivation, complexity, or tedious tasks. In the latest years, we saw thousands of educational applications being created with gamification in mind. Nevertheless, this has been an unsustainable growth with ad hoc designs and implementations of educational gamified applications, hampering interoperability and the reuse of good practices. This chapter presents a systematic study on gamification standardization aiming to characterize the status of the field, namely describing existing frameworks, languages, services, and platforms. © 2023, IGI Global.

"Math Learning in a Science Museum—Proposal for a Workshop Design Based on STEAM Strategy to Learn Mathematics. The Case of the Cryptography Workshop","Roldán-Zafra J.; Perea C.","2022","Mathematics","2","Article","EN","In mathematics teaching, great efforts are made, and diverse teaching strategies are employed in order to facilitate students’ learning process. Informal environments have proven to be conducive and motivating spaces for science learning. In particular, science museums can be used as a complement and collaborate in order to leverage each of their strengths to motivate mathematics learning. Educational models give a global explanation to the learning process. Taking into account all these aspects and considering van Hiele’s model as didactic reference, we propose the design of a general workshop that has among its objectives the learning of mathematics. To do this, we start from the three main elements and processes set forth in van Hiele’s model: insight, reasoning levels and learning phases. The insight or student’s competence are formulated through Hoffer’s abilities, and for the development of the activities of the learning phases, the STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art and maths) strategy. Once the general proposal has been made, we use it to design a scientific workshop for learning mathematics about cryptography. Our greatest challenge was in generating activities adapted to the established requirements. It would be interesting, for future works, to design research to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposal presented. Moreover, it would be interesting to develop a proposal for assessing student learning. © 2022 by the authors."

In computer science education, a small private online programming course (SPOPC) is an important curriculum course to enhance the students' problem-solving, creative thinking and teamwork activities. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the influences of students' composite engagements (learning performances and personal feelings) in a SPOPC. We applied an online engagement framework for higher education and partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) approach. Our analysis was conducted from a Python programming course at Feng Chia University, Taiwan, held in the fall semester of 2021-2022 through OpenEdu platform. Our results show that (1) Strongest mediator performance was 'Video watching' affected by four significant relations; (2) Behavioral engagement 'BE' and emotional engagement 'EE' are positively affected 'Video watching' performance and they were inextricably linked factors; (3) Social engagement 'SE' significantly affected the 'Term project' and 'Final score' through 'Midtest'; (4) Cognitive engagement 'CE' did not significantly affect the 'Term project'; Most important is that (5) Students' first feelings about the course (the first part of the semester) are important factors in deciding to continue a related course or drop out of the course in the future. These findings have valuable practical implications for course instructors who design and lead the programming course.  © 2022 ACM."

LAES requires the same required math and science courses of standard engineering degrees, adding upper-level concentrations split equally between advanced engineering and humanities courses. LAES was designed for retaining and recruiting a diversity of students in engineering, and to address recent innovations in industrial practice, technology design, and community-centered education. Through fifteen years of trial and error, the LAES program has developed a set of meaning-filled design guidelines for project work, combining engineering and humanistic problem solving with sustainable environmental practice integrated throughout every aspect of design, production, and use. In partnership with many departments across campus, especially Cal Poly's architecture program, LAES has worked on many projects that exist within the complex economic, political, social, spatial, and cultural needs of local communities. LAES projects in collaboration with architecture students, have ranged from community housing construction with re-purposed shipping containers, to re-designing pedestrian neighborhood corridors, to the use of narrative-driven STEM education modules with underserved middle school students, to the design of immersive-reality explorations of artificial coral ecologies off the coast of California. In this paper, we review what we have learned from our project work, with a focus on student learning assessment, leadership training, working across disciplines, and teamwork management, demonstrating how those practical academic concerns interact with the instruction of our design principles.

The essay presents a programme that combines formal and informal learning to develop these skills and competencies for students in Singapore. This programme offers informal hands-on workshops, provided by the Science Center Singapore, for 7-10th-grade students, whose formal learning programme is provided by the Ministry of Education. The science centre also provides professional development for the school teachers, links key industry partners to each participating school, and offers country-wide STEM annual competitions for the students. The programme is based on a two-tier structure: a basic level of hands-on workshops and investigations to excite all students and a second level of deeper engagement for developing further STEM skills and competency. Educational research supports the conclusion that informal science programming helped the students increase their enjoyment, interest, and understanding of STEM in everyday life and that it is very important to implement the programme without exams and with plenty of time for the students to play, tinker, discover, and learn. The programme demonstrates that collaboration between informal and formal STEM educators can build deeper self-efficacy and confidence in STEM students by designing activities that build mastery, while providing appropriate scaffolding for students, as they progress through different levels of ability. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Judy Diamond and Sherman Rosenfeld; individual chapters, the contributors."

The inquiry process in Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) invites children to wonder, experiment, invent, and create collaboratively in a learning environment that appreciates play and imagination. However, more is needed to know about how children’s imagination and invention process manifest in the context of sustainable education. This chapter examines preschool-aged children’s sustainable learning through imagination during a creative sustainable STEAM education project, “the Sustainable Fox,” in Finnish early childhood education. We present two case examples illustrating the identified imaginary and creative learning situations and contextualizing their nature in sustainable education. The findings emphasize two aspects that support children’s imagination and creativity in sustainable development education that have also emerged from previous studies: interaction and materiality. For example, Groth argues that thinking and knowing are concretely entangled with materiality. When children are handling materials, they have a direct channel for interacting with our environment. Building on this idea, we conclude by presenting an imagination-driven approach that highlights children’s innate ability to become creative, proactive, and informed citizens who actively contribute to a sustainable future aligned with SDG4. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Weipeng Yang, Sarika Kewalramani and Jyoti Senthil; individual chapters, the contributors."

"Teaching Elementary School Pupils How to Code – Design and Delivery of a Programming Course","Moanes T.H.","2023","New Perspectives in Science Education - International Conference","0","Article","EN","Elementary school pupils are interacting with mobile applications on a daily basis and are considered as digital native generation. Behind the development of such applications, there is a lot of hard work in programming that involves among other things, skills in programming and skills in algorithmic thinking. Learning programming is not easy for all students and neither for children. Programmers use mathematics, science, design, technology, and art to create their products. Thus, the understanding of the STEM concepts will help in designing new computer programs and applications. Furthermore, it is clear that in today's modern world coding is a basic skill and is especially important in STEM. In recent years, several academic institutions and companies have made much effort in developing web-based learning platforms to facilitate the teaching and learning of the foundations of computer science and programming. Most of these online programming environments are free, interactive and user-friendly. They have become easy to use, very attractive and helpful for teaching children how to code, during school and after school, but they are not based on comprehensive methodologies so that, the fundamentals of coding can be easily understood by pupils. The current research examined the teaching of a programming course to elementary school pupils, after school, based on the following three online interactive environments: ""Plastelina"", “Code with Anna and Elsa”, and ""Turtle Academy"". The research included the development, implementation and evaluation of the course, which comprised of 13 meetings, total of 26 hours, taught to 42 pupils of 4th and 5th grades at two elementary schools in the center of Israel. The teaching and learning approaches that have been combined in this course were mainly game-, problem-and project-based approaches. In addition, the research aimed to investigate the pupils' attitudes toward the learning of computer programming, both before and after the participation in the course. Research data were collected by means of pre-post attitude questionnaire, written exam, and analysis of the final project and class observations. The findings indicated that the pupils' attitudes towards programming in general and towards motivation, competition, and challenge increased after the participation in the course. © 2023, Pixel Associazione.

This conceptual turn in education implies profound institutional and philosophical changes. Central to this turn has been the development of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Math (STEAM) education. In this article, we detail a progression from an existing model of pedagogical principles and educational objectives in science education within a global STEAM education environment, Global Science Opera, towards shared pedagogical principles and educational objectives in both science and arts education within that same environment. In this work, we rely on a transdisciplinary approach towards the integrated disciplines and the educators who teach them. We outline the need for the new, integrated approach to be validated in other, empirical, contexts in order to establish its capacity in the field of creativity in education, and specifically in global STEAM environments in order to ensure its relevance to teaching and learning of a kind which strengthen students` knowledge, abilities and democratic and inclusive values. We propose the Janus metaphor for the new approach as it represents the possibility of having a double perspective of a single focus of attention.

This is due to the fact that cloud computing users are in a brand-new IT business paradigm. It holds the potential of moving away from a paradigm where businesses have to spend extensively on in-house IT resources in favour of one where they can purchase or rent services managed by a cloud provider and pay as they go for them. There is a significant shortcoming or shortage of finances among smaller educational institutions to effectively use Technology. Education, especially in outlying and impoverished areas, may benefit greatly from cloud computing’s potential to improve both its quality and accessibility. It may provide improved communication and collaboration amongst educators in different places, allowing for more engaging and dynamic classroom activities. Additionally, cloud-based solutions may provide clients/academic institutions with cost savings and exposure to state-of-the-art computing. In this chapter, some of the most significant security challenges that arise when using e-learning applications in conjunction with cloud computing and big data are discussed.

Thus, boosting and passing on the local music culture to pre-school and elementary school students are urgent requirements. This study proposes an interactive integration of multi-sensory and volumetric content for music education in Taiwan into applications for children. Further, the study introduces a technological multi-sensory pop-up sketch book created in collaboration with the National Taiwan Symphony Orchestra (NTSO) and Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI). Both organizations collaborate to integrate emerging media technologies, including augmented reality (AR) and volumetric capture for content production, and creative music teaching methods, derived from traditional pop-up sketch books. The final product featured 3D animated videos to achieve interactive learning with digital formation additional to the real worlds. This AR multi-sensory pop-up sketch book utilizes advanced volumetric capture technology to capture the motions of main actors in vivid 3D animation. Besides, modularized pop-up cards of musical instruments provide a haptic experience to complement the story. The book targets children aged between 3 and 12 years. An actual reading survey was conducted on 497 students from five kindergartens in Taiwan. Satisfaction with the book was rated using a five-rank scale. The cluster random sampling method was used for data analysis. Results of t-test produced an average score of 4.9980, which indicated that the target audience ranked the book with high levels of satisfaction. The results also confirmed that the story line was familiar among young children within the target age range. Additionally, using digital audio–visual augmented reality technology will be conducive to young children in terms of acceptance and recognition of traditional music culture. 3D animations of famous intellectual property characters aroused the interest of readers in learning about music through interactive contents. Moreover, this study provided evidence that the STEAM education model, which represents a cross-curricular approach that integrates Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics, is applicable to the inheritance and development of the local music culture. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

The spread of woody plants into grasslands, known as the “Green Glacier,” poses a risk to biodiversity and animal production. Although effective management strategies exist, some land managers are reluctant to use them. It is critical to cultivate a scientifically literate population that can think systematically and make informed decisions based on STEM principles to address such complex agroecosystem problems. Methods: In this study, semi-structured focus group discussions with high school students were analyzed to determine whether Prairie Protector, an educational game, and its associated resources led to evidence of systems thinking habits in student conversation. Results: Analysis of the focus group transcripts revealed that the students developed systems thinking habits through their experience playing Prairie Protector while developing empathy for land managers and others involved in the Great Plains agroecosystem. In general, students found the game enjoyable and a useful tool for learning about agroecosystems, conservation land management, and the spread of invasive species. Discussion: Analysis of the student statements led to the development of a guiding framework to assess and analyze students development of systems thinking habits that could be used to scaffold student learning experiences to explore, understand, and interact with complex systems. Providing simulated environments for students to interact with complex systems should be explored in additional scenarios to support student development of systems thinking skills.

"Future STEAMpreneurs: Using Creative Ecosystems for Educating 'Anti-Disciplinary Wrong-Thinking Strange-Makers'","Vaisnore A.; Janiunaite B.; Petraite M.","2023","2023 IEEE International Conference on Technology and Entrepreneurship, ICTE 2023","1","Conference paper","EN","The complex challenges of the world require a new set of skills from higher education graduates, basically defined as STEAM (science, technology, engineering, the arts, and mathematics) skills, with a specific focus on the ability to innovate and make an entrepreneurial change. The task is complex and challenging as the new skill set requires a review of both the composition of the competence framework and education methods while embedding the curriculum within local ecosystems, communities, and challenges. This paper aims to reveal the development of a new set of skills that transcend the traditional disciplines via the integration of art and creativity methods, as immersive, sensory, kinetic, experiential, and other nonconventional learning experiences while embedding the learning in local ecosystems. We apply an action-based research method, where 30 students participate in an intensive STEAM creativity and innovation management development week. As a result, we propose an extension of STEAM competencies with arts-inspired elements and prove the efficiency of art-inspired methods in ecosystem-embedded learning.  © 2023 IEEE."
"STEM learning, science identity and immersivity: Giant screen films comparing 2D, 3D, and dome formats including a videogame assessment","Johnson-Glenberg M.C.; Kosa M.; O'Rourke H.P.","2023","Frontiers in Education","3","Article","EN","Multiple assessments, including a novel videogame methodology, were used to understand how viewing a Giant Screen film in four different formats affected both science identity associated with liking science and desire to be a scientist, and learning gains on STEM content. Participants were 406 5th graders who were randomly assigned to watch the 45-min film called Amazon Adventure in either a (1) 2D Small Screen, (2) 2D Giant Flat Screen, (3) 3D Giant Flat Screen, or (4) curved Dome condition. The conditions increased in levels of immersivity as listed. In this 4 × 3 design, the first factor was viewing condition and the second was test time including pretests, posttests, and two-month followup on content knowledge tests relating to natural selection. The strongest pattern was seen at the followup time point where the three more immersive conditions (2D Giant Screen, 3D Giant Screen, and Dome) outperformed the Small Screen condition on the science identity measures of liking science and wanting to be a scientist when grown up. Additionally, two of the more immersive conditions performed significantly better at both posttest and followup on the videogame that assessed natural selection and mimicry knowledge. Significant gender effects at followup revealed that females in the two most immersive conditions (3D Flat and Dome) liked science significantly more and wanted to be a scientist more than males when grown. Interestingly, females also played the videogame significantly better than the males at both posttest and followup. These results suggest that increases in the immersivity of a film can have longer term effects on science identity, and those effects are stronger in females. Additionally, as more assessments are being designed in a gamified manner, designers/researchers should keep game-style (i.e., strategy games) and gender interactions in mind. It had not been predicted that the females would outperform the males on the STEM assessment videogame, but deduction games like the one in this study are probably capturing more than knowledge about natural selection, they may be a proxies for general intelligence or g. More research is needed on game type and gender effects during the school-age developmental span. Copyright © 2023 Johnson-Glenberg, Kosa and O'Rourke."

Alongside the call for humanity-oriented applications in education, AI robotsupported precision education has developed into an active field, with increasing literature available. This study aimed to comprehensively analyze directions taken in the past in this research field to interpret a roadmap for future work. By adopting structural topic modeling, the Mann-Kendall trend test, and keyword analysis, we investigated the research topics and their dynamics in the field based on literature collected from Web of Science and Scopus databases up to 2021. Results showed that AI robots and chatbots had been widely used in different subject areas (e.g., early education, STEM education, medical, nursing, and healthcare education, and language education) for promoting collaborative learning, mobile/game-based learning, distance learning, and affective learning. However, a limited practice in developing true human-centered AI (HCAI)-supported educational robots is available. To advance HCAI in education and its application in educational robots for precision education, we suggested involving humans in AI robot design, thinking of individual learners, testing, and understanding the learner–AI robot interaction, taking an HCAI multidisciplinary approach in robot system development, and providing sufficient technical support for instructors during robot implementation. © 2023,Educational Technology and Society.All Rights Reserved."

The purpose of this chapter was to investigate how items from recycled materials could be used in STEAM activities to act as an enabler to advance sustainable development goals in the early years. This chapter draws from a STEAM workshop where coresearchers from two semirural areas in South Africa collaborate to construct meaning from experiences within an action learning group (ALG). Participatory action learning and action research (PALAR) was used as the research design and the data generation method was limited to action learning group discussions. Thematic content analysis was used to analyze the data. Integrity was ensured by following the five quality indicators as set out by Herr and Anderson. The findings highlight that encouraging young children to use items from recycled material is part of educating them about sustainability.

"Teaching Mathematics through art: Developing spatial skills and digital literacy of children with learning challenges through visual arts education","Kugler E.; Kárpáti A.","2023","Arts-Based Interventions and Social Change in Europe","1","Book chapter","EN","In Hungarian public education, one of the major challenges is to support students challenged with social disadvantages, learning deficits and mental and behavioural problems. The mission of an interdisciplinary team of teachers of Visual Arts Education and Mathematics is to use the power of the arts for opening creative channels in students to arrive at the deeper understanding visually. Our intervention addressed negative attitudes to learning and verbalisation in knowledge production. We exploited the role of arts for visualising knowledge acquisition and overcoming barriers between scientific and artistic domains. Thirty students of Grade 5 of the compulsory elementary school (average age: 10.7 years), previously diagnosed with special needs (ADHD and ADD), participated in a three-semester remedial programme of four, 60-90 minutes, after regular instructions. The theoretical foundation of our interdisciplinary pedagogy was the Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics (STEAM) education model. Intersecting areas of Mathematics and Visual Culture were identified in space and plane geometry and incorporated in collaborative projects. We employed a variety of scientific visualisation techniques for Mathematics instruction (e.g., infographic design and interpretation, modelling of geometric rules and phenomena in 3D) and incorporated in creative tasks. Visual competence was assessed through standardised spatial skills tests and a process-oriented portfolio method, and significant development of visual language use was detected. Improvement in Mathematics was assessed through standardised national tests that revealed impressive growth. This chapter ends with policy implications of the use of arts-based methods to enhance cognitive abilities of students with social, behavioural and learning challenges. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Andrea Kárpáti."
"Cultivating Computational Thinking through Game-Based Learning","Adam K.; Lightfoot R.; Chowdhury M.; Phillip Donaldson J.","2023","Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE","0","Conference paper","EN","Game-based learning (GBL) can motivate learners and enable them to engage in their learning experience. Additionally, the popularity of GBL has grown in computer science and programming courses, where it can be used to develop computational thinking (CT) skills. CT is critical thinking used to apply fundamental concepts and reasoning derived from computing and computer science. Research has shown that digital GBL can improve critical thinking skills and help learners understand programming concepts, structures, and problem-solving strategies. Despite the popularity of digital GBL, analog card games and bingo games are still valuable and effective tools for learning. However, most studies on GBL that aim to train critical thinking skills have focused on digital approaches. This indicates a gap in the body of knowledge because few studies have explored the effectiveness of analog games for developing CT skills through GBL. The theoretical framework of this study is grounded in two learning theories. Constructivist theory frames learning as the construction of knowledge through a process of action, reflection, and construction. Constructionist learning theory calls for construction of artifacts, learner agency, authentic purpose, or authentic audience during the process. To investigate the design of GBL for developing CT skills and to generate discourse for its widespread adoption, the current study implemented design-based research (DBR) in an undergraduate computer science course for non-computer science majors. By addressing the gap in the literature on GBL for CT skill development, the study aimed to investigate complex learner experiences, including learner struggles and successes, alignment with learning theory principles, and design moves for future iterations of the project. The research question posed is: how can we optimize CT learning through GBL, based on learner experiences and learning theories? Prior to this study, the instructor used GBL in which learners played an analog, three-dimensional tic-tac-toe game with ping pong balls and then wrote a computer program that simulated that game. We chose to conduct DBR to strengthen the learning associated with this activity. DBR uses iterative designs to develop knowledge that improves educational practices. In the spring of 2023, we assessed the extent to which the non-digital game and programming the simulated game enhanced learners' CT skills by analyzing their experiences with CT. This involved collecting and analyzing learner surveys to gain insight into their learning experiences. Using network analysis and betweenness centrality measures, the data will be analyzed to identify learner struggles and successes. The results are expected to be available by August 2023. The contributions of this study include identifying effective design principles for GBL, optimizing CT learning, and generating discourse for the widespread adoption of GBL in computer science education. © 2023 IEEE."

"PIXEL: Challenges of Designing a Professional Board Game for Astronomy Education","Inchingolo G.; Toniolo R.; Varano S.; Ligabue A.; Ricciardi S.","2023","Proceedings of the European Conference on Games-based Learning","1","Conference paper","EN","PIXEL - Picture (of) the Universe is a board game developed by INAF - IT National Institute for Astrophysics in collaboration with GAME Science Research Center. The game simulates the astrophysics research environment, particularly emphasising the observation and study of cosmic bodies at different resolutions. Image resolution is a crucial element in astrophysics, but the intrinsic complexity and challenges of making high-resolution images of the distant Universe are not easily and generally perceivable. We envisioned PIXEL driven by this challenge. Games intended to engage students with science either concentrate on the contents to foster the learning process or focus on life skills solicited by scientific practices. Game mechanics are then either a leverage of scientific knowledge or a science-like behavioural model, depending on the expected outcome of the game-based learning process. In addition to that, game-based learning in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) generally is designed by science practitioners and science communication and education experts. The design process of PIXEL has been a novel joint effort between scientists, science communicators, professional game designers, and game-market and award advisors. We produced a game in which the mechanics are the core of scientific learning, implicitly telling about science while making the player experience it. The innovation of this process is to obtain a game that encountered positive feedback both from the community of game experts and the educational context. The final output is a professional board game suitable for STEM education that promotes scientific citizenship in the audience. In this work, we discuss the game design process and describe how we included our scientific educational messages of image resolution and research dynamics as processes within the game mechanics without making them explicit during the gameplay. We also present a preliminary engagement evaluation of PIXEL and its efficacy in delivering implicit scientific messages through its mechanics. © 2023 Dechema e.V.. All rights reserved."

Teachers and students pivoted from face-to-face engagement to online environments, thus impacting curriculum, pedagogy, and student outcomes across a variety of disciplines. In this paper, the authors focus on science/STEM teachers’ experiences with online teaching and learning in a Canadian context during the pandemic. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected through an online questionnaire administered to 75 Grade 1–12 science/STEM teachers in a Canadian province in May–July 2020. Through the TPACK framework and self-efficacy theory, the authors explore i) curriculum planning and implementation in online settings, ii) assessment practices and their effectiveness, and iii) student outcomes, as observed by the teachers. Results indicate that teachers used a variety of platforms, and choice of platform was mainly due to user-friendliness and interactivity, or administrative decision making. Despite teachers organizing online lessons during ERT, gaps were identified in teachers’ TPACK framework and self-efficacy, thus impacting their curriculum development, pedagogical approaches, and assessment practices. In general, teaching strategies included pre-recorded videos and self-directed learning in which teachers assigned specific tasks for students to perform independently. Teachers prioritized subject content and covering curriculum objectives over creative and student-centered pedagogical approaches. Assessment techniques employed were viewed by teachers as unauthentic and generally ineffective. Moreover, teachers reported difficulties addressing student needs and abilities, resulting in challenges providing equitable and inclusive online teaching. Finally, online teaching was viewed negatively by most teachers, in terms of student engagement and outcomes. © The Author(s) 2022."
"The mysterious adventures of Detective Duke: How storified programming MOOCs support learners in achieving their learning goals","Hagedorn C.; Serth S.; Meinel C.","2023","Frontiers in Education","4","Article","EN","About 15 years ago, the first Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) appeared and revolutionized online education with more interactive and engaging course designs. Yet, keeping learners motivated and ensuring high satisfaction is one of the challenges today's course designers face. Therefore, many MOOC providers employed gamification elements that only boost extrinsic motivation briefly and are limited to platform support. In this article, we introduce and evaluate a gameful learning design we used in several iterations on computer science education courses. For each of the courses on the fundamentals of the Java programming language, we developed a self-contained, continuous story that accompanies learners through their learning journey and helps visualize key concepts. Furthermore, we share our approach to creating the surrounding story in our MOOCs and provide a guideline for educators to develop their own stories. Our data and the long-term evaluation spanning over four Java courses between 2017 and 2021 indicates the openness of learners toward storified programming courses in general and highlights those elements that had the highest impact. While only a few learners did not like the story at all, most learners consumed the additional story elements we provided. However, learners' interest in influencing the story through majority voting was negligible and did not show a considerable positive impact, so we continued with a fixed story instead. We did not find evidence that learners just participated in the narrative because they worked on all materials. Instead, for 10–16% of learners, the story was their main course motivation. We also investigated differences in the presentation format and concluded that several longer audio-book style videos were most preferred by learners in comparison to animated videos or different textual formats. Surprisingly, the availability of a coherent story embedding examples and providing a context for the practical programming exercises also led to a slightly higher ranking in the perceived quality of the learning material (by 4%). With our research in the context of storified MOOCs, we advance gameful learning designs, foster learner engagement and satisfaction in online courses, and help educators ease knowledge transfer for their learners.

However, optimizing the learning outcomes of students engaged in game-based environments requires aligning the game design with diverse student needs. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of player behavior is crucial for identifying students who need additional support or modifications to the game design. This study applies an Ordered Network Analysis (ONA)—a specific kind of Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA)—to examine the game trace log data of student interactions, to gain insights into how learning gains relate to the different ways that students move through an open-ended virtual world for learning microbiology. Our findings reveal that differences between students with high and low learning gains are mediated by their prior knowledge. Specifically, level of prior knowledge is related to behaviors that resemble wheel-spinning, which warrant the development of future interventions.

However, they are often not competent in designing TEL due to their lack of experience as participatory designers as well as the ill-structure nature of TEL design problem. Design thinking, as a methodology and a framework for the design process, can serve as a guideline for the development of pre-service teachers' creativity. However, there is a lack of research investigating whether the strategies used in the empathizing stage of the design thinking process affect pre-service teachers' creativity differently. This study explored the effects of two commonly used empathy strategies, interview and observation, on pre-service teachers' creativity through a six-week learning design activity for pre-service teachers majoring in Science and Technology Education at a first-tier university in China. The results of this quasi-experimental research showed that the pre-service teachers using the interview empathy strategy performed better in creative problem-solving performance. While there was no significant difference in the pre-service teachers' creative thinking disposition between the two empathy strategies, the pre-service teachers using the interview strategy reported more positive creative confidence in their creativity than those using the observation strategy.

The PICA-PICA concept was implemented, used and tested in real-life, by upper primary school students in Japan, during a 4-day workshop. Initial results illustrated the quality of the solution proposed by PICA-PICA. We noted that the integration was perceived as smooth, and not contrived: all participants understood how to use the PICA-PICA environment to engineer programmable art objects. Furthermore, the PICA-PICA approach led to high motivation: children did not get bored and were fully engaged. Finally, the quality of their work as a learning outcome was high: by including a programming segment with the other expressive activities in the artwork, the children were able to design the electronics in a more concentrated and meaningful way than their curriculum-structured learning.

"Investigating Adolescents’ Participation Trajectories in a Collaborative Multimodal Composing Learning Environment","Jiang S.","2023","Educational Technology and Society","1","Article","EN","The field of STEM education calls for a nuanced understanding of participation as participation measured by attendance provides limited information about student learning. This multiple case study contributes to a nuanced understanding of youth’s participation trajectories in a multimodal composition project. In the project, fifth to eighth grade students worked in small groups to create multimodal science fiction stories in which they needed to propose creative solutions to issues related to climate change. In this study, I adopted two theoretical perspectives, disciplinary identity development and community of practice, to analyze participation trajectories with multiple sources of data. This study shows that STEM practices mediated by multiple modes can not only offer students flexibility in moving across forms of participation, but also open space for them to demonstrate their expertise as knowledge producers. Furthermore, this study suggests that the following strategies could be effective for broadening participation in STEM practices: supporting the development of reflective understanding of connections between disciplines through digital literacies, providing exposure in composing with multiple modes, focusing on building a close relation between self and digital artifacts, and offering flexibility in moving across interactional spaces. These insights shed light on broadening participation in other multimodal learning settings. © This article of the journal of Educational Technology & Society is available under Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-ND 3.0 license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/)."

A research team interviewed two teachers and one administrator at the school to better understand the nuances of pre-college engineering during a pandemic year and how changes in school and district policy affected the instructional delivery of STEAM projects. Narrative analytic methods were utilized to understand each participant’s experience and an inductive content thematic approach was used to develop the findings. The participants described varied experiences navigating instruction during the pandemic, particularly when adapting hands-on STEAM projects for virtual or hybrid teaching. All three participants thought deeply about how to best meet the needs of students while attempting to support equitable instruction. The findings of this study indicate that pre-college engineering in the pandemic was challenging for the participants, but not impossible, and that this setting was an appropriate context for STEAM projects that provided students with a mechanism for collaboration and engagement. © 2022, Purdue University Press.

"From STEM to STEAM: An Enactive and Ecological Continuum","Videla R.; Aguayo C.; Veloz T.","2021","Frontiers in Education","18","Article","EN","STEM and STEAM education promotes the integration between science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and the arts. The latter aims at favoring deep and collaborative learning on students, through curricular integration in K-12 science education. The enactive and ecological psychology approach to education puts attention on the role of the teacher, learning context and socio-cultural environment in shaping lived learning experiences. The approach describes education as a process of embodied cognitive assemblage of guided perception and action. The latter process depends on the interaction of learners with digital and/or analogue learning affordances existing within the socio-technological environment. This article proposes that the scope of an enactive-ecological approach can be extended to the domain of learning science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM), especially when it comes to understanding deep roots of the learning process. We first present an exhaustive literature review regarding the foundations of both the enactive and the ecological learning theories, along with their differences and key similarities. We then describe the fundamentals and latest research advances of an integrated STEAM pedagogy, followed by the notion of mixed reality (XR) as an emerging educational technology approach, offering an understanding of its current foundations and general disposition on how to understand digital immersion from ecological psychology. Next, we propose a systems theoretical approach to integrate the enactive-ecological approach in STEAM pedagogy, framed in the Santiago school of cognition attending to the interactive dynamics occurring between learners and their interaction with learning affordances existing within their educational medium, establishing that sensorimotor contingencies and attentional anchors are important to restrict sensory variety and stabilize learning concepts. Finally, we consider two empirical studies, one from Chile and the other from New Zealand, in which we demonstrate how the enactive-ecological approach built upon a systems theory perspective can contribute to understanding the roots of STEAM learning and inform its learning design. © Copyright © 2021 Videla, Aguayo and Veloz."

With active learning strategies becoming a preferred method of instruction, a collaboration of authors from four universities (University of Pittsburgh, University of Connecticut, Rowan University and New Jersey Institute of Technology) are investigating how game-based or playful learning with strongly situated components can influence first-year engineering students' ethical knowledge, awareness, and decision making. This paper offers an overview and results of the progress to date of this three year, NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) grant that aims to (1) characterize the ethical awareness and decision making of first-year engineering students, (2) develop game-based learning interventions focused on ethical decision making, and (3) determine how (and why) game-based approaches affect students' ethical awareness in engineering and the advantages of such approaches over non game-based approaches. Now in its second year, the authors have conducted a preliminary analysis of first-year students' ethical knowledge and organization via a concept mapping approach and have measured students' ethical reasoning using the Defining Issues Test 2 (DIT2) and Engineering Ethics Reasoning Instrument (EERI). Further, the authors have developed a suite of ethics-driven games that have been implemented across three of the universities, engaging over 400 first-year engineering students. Evaluation data has also been gathered for further game development and to assess initial student engagement and learning. Year 1 has provided insight into where first-year engineering students “are at” in terms of ethical knowledge and reasoning when they come to college, and how game-based instruction can be effective in the development of these students into moral agents who understand the consequences of their decisions. Further results from this investigation will provide the engineering education community with a set of impactful and research-based playful learning pedagogy and assessment that will help students confront social and ethical dilemmas in their professional lives. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022"

In this study we explored an instructor’s drivers and motivators for change in perspectives and practice, with an emphasis on the impact of an internal community (her ‘instructional team’) comprised of a co-instructor, graduate teaching assistants, and several undergraduate learning assistants (LAs). Data were collected over two semesters through classroom observations, interviews, faculty learning community discussion recordings, and team email communications. We identified pedagogical discontentment as a primary initial trigger for the instructor’s engagement in instructional reform, guided by personal values and beliefs about student learning and the nature of her discipline. The instructional-team community, which was established during a period of instructional distress, provided 1) consistent support in instructional planning, implementation, assessment, and reflection processes, 2) unique access to different perspectives on the nuances of the teaching environment and student challenges, 3) increased space, time, and motivation for the instructor to more critically reflect on her teaching and engage in creative instructional design. This case illustrates the potential effects of instructional team-based communities on instructors as they work to improve their practice and reform their courses. © The Author(s) 2021."

This interdisciplinary curriculum approach employed ‘ethical dilemma story pedagogy’ in a STEAM education project designed to engage students in values-based chemistry learning. Drawing on the arts, specially written ethical dilemma stories posing real-world environmental problems engaged students in exploring their value systems. Students reflected on the pros and cons of ethical dilemmas related to the everyday use of artificial fertilizers, disposal of used cooking oil and detergent waste, and environmental pollution caused by plastic waste. The purpose of the study was to investigate the potential of the Ethical Dilemma STEAM Teaching Model to empower Indonesian secondary school students with both chemistry knowledge and transdisciplinary capabilities for resolving environmental problems. The researchers conducted an interpretive case study of four high-school chemistry classes to understand students’ learning experiences and outcomes. Data were obtained from students’ reflective journals, semi-structured interviews, and classroom observations. The results demonstrate that students engaged in deep chemistry learning while simultaneously developing critical reflective social thinking, collaborative decision-making skills, and increased awareness of the need to protect the environment in order to support sustainable development. The study revealed that chemistry education can play a strategic role through ethical values learning in empowering students to become agents of change for environmental sustainability. Further research is warranted into the efficacy of the Ethical Dilemma STEAM Teaching Model for empowering students in sustainability education across a broad range of science-related topics and sociocultural contexts. © 2022 by the authors.

We designed and developed a game to teach middle grade students (ages 11-13) CS through block-based programming challenges. The game integrates a UMC pedagogical framework to promote successful student outcomes for a wide variety of student abilities, including those without prior programming experience. Utilizing a mixed-methods research design, we investigated how the game influenced student learning of CS concepts and the role of UMC on the problem-solving strategies students applied to complete the game. In particular, we were interested in how prior experience would moderate these outcomes. Results from a multilevel model of students' pre-and post-assessment scores (N = 77) on a CS concepts assessment indicated that all students, regardless of prior programming experience, showed significant learning gains from pre to post after playing the game. Qualitative results revealed that the UMC scaffolding progression provided students, particularly those with little to no prior programming experience, with the foundational knowledge needed to progress through the game levels and challenges. Specifically, we found that the Use phases of the game reduced novice students' cognitive load and facilitated the necessary CS conceptual understanding to solve the open-ended programming tasks encountered in the game's Modify and Create phases. Our findings demonstrate the efficacy of UMC to support the learning of novice programmers in a game-based learning environment while not to the detriment of those more experienced.  © 2021 ACM."
"ZORQ: A Gamification Framework for Computer Science Education","Hastings J.; Weitl-Harms S.; Spanier A.; Rokusek M.; Henszey R.","2022","Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE","5","Conference paper","EN","This research paper introduces a unique system called ZORQ that is a combination of a game development framework and a gamification framework (GDGF). The ZORQ GDGF acts as a catalyst to help motivate students by increasing student engagement and success within undergraduate Computer Science (CS) education, regardless of student experience and background. The dynamic gamification elements utilized within the GDGF make it an attractive learning method for students. After collaborative game space customization, ZORQ gameplay sees each student tasked with designing a ship movement philosophy and then implementing their own code to autonomously control the ship in an interstellar game space filled with supplies, obstacles, and enemy ships. The particulars of engagements between ships can vary greatly by semester, along with the resources/objects present in the game, depending on the collaborative customization and the independent ship strategies implemented.A preliminary ZORQ trial was conducted over five years in an undergraduate Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course. The ZORQ trial is designed to fulfill the following objectives: 1) implement DSA concepts discussed within the course, 2) identify appropriate problem-solving approaches, 3) apply one or more solutions, 4) build depth with a coding language, 5) bridge the gap between limited concept assignments and large, multi-developer software systems by allowing students to build code within a larger architecture, 6) introduce students to version control, 7) illustrate the use of prior mathematics coursework in practical applications, and 8) introduce unit testing in software systems. In exit surveys, students expressed overwhelming satisfaction with this approach. More than 84% of the students surveyed found the system useful in their educational experience and saw benefit to inspecting a completed software project. 82% of the students found that ZORQ increased software development comprehension. 80% enjoyed using their own personal creativity in designing a ship controller, 76% found ZORQ helped them learn how to implement and use DSAs. 71% found the system engaging and found the system interaction to be clear and understandable. Observations of student performance in later courses suggest better student maturity and comprehension in preparation for proposing and implementing their own independent projects. © 2022 IEEE."

"Orchestrating a culture-aligned adoption and adaptation of an instructional innovation: A story of an engineering professor's pedagogical decisions between innovation and school culture","Lee Y.; Evenhouse D.A.; Berger E.J.; Rhoads J.F.; Deboer J.","2022","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings","0","Conference paper","EN","Engineering education researchers and practitioners have driven instructional innovation in undergraduate engineering instruction. Much of the research about educational innovation has focused on undergraduate classrooms in large enrollment courses and/or research-intensive institutions. Propagation of innovations across settings, especially those quite unlike the original context, has received less attention in the literature. This includes liberal arts institutions, which collectively educate a large number of undergraduate engineering students in various contexts. Therefore, this study focuses on the implementation of an instructional innovation in a liberal arts institution that started a new engineering program to educate a regional engineering workforce. This qualitative study documented the experiences of one engineering instructor who adopted and adapted a blended learning environment for undergraduate dynamics designed to promote active and collaborative learning in undergraduate engineering courses. We analyzed interviews, documents, artifacts, visual materials, and field notes to examine the propagation of the instructional system in context with cultural features in local institution settings. Our findings show how an engineering instructor orchestrated a culture-aligned adoption and adaptation of an instructional innovation. Using reflective practice, the research participant adapted the implemented innovative instruction to their hands-on institution culture, such as adjusting expectations in content, adapting resources to students' individual needs, adjusting uncertainty of problem solving, and adapting to a hands-on institution culture. This research highlights the important role of institutional culture in local adaptations of educational innovations, and it provides the community with an expanded way to think about innovation propagation. Improving teaching and learning has been an important issue in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. Alternative to traditional engineering instruction that focused on delivering content knowledge, researchers have promoted active learning that focus on increasing student participation and engagement learning [1], [2]. However, despite consistent efforts to disseminate active learning pedagogies, traditional lecture still dominates undergraduate STEM education [3]. Many researchers contend that various challenges hinder instructors from adopting using research-based instructional strategies (RBIS) due to student resistance, limited time for course preparation, and lack of institutional support and rewards [4] - [6]. To promote the use of RBIS for instructors, Froyd et al. [7] maintain that researchers aim to implement RBIS to fit local contexts through collaboration with potential adopters. They emphasized the importance of fit in local context and individual instructors' decisions to adopt and adapt the original RBIS. However, despite their attentions to general needs in local context for instructional innovation, little attention was paid to what specific local context were associated with individual instructors' instructional adaptation. The aim of this study was to explore an engineering instructor's pedagogical decisions between innovation and institutional culture. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022."

In direct cooperation with the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports and other partners the project focuses on the following: 1) designing, creating, and verifying the on-line system (software) for setting the adequate form of technical education that would enable schools to successfully reach the expected learning results; 2) designing and verifying learning situations; 3) developing innovative teaching aids (mobile toolkits enabling sharing). The above results and products will make a positive contribution to the development of pupils' competencies-in particular, basic scientific and technical competences consisting of cognitive, motoric, social, social-moral and information-communication competencies that ensure that individuals 'participate in the use of technology as an element of culture'. Specifically, the following can be mentioned: the ability to solve problems, the ability to apply creative ideas in pupils' work, the ability to take responsibility, the ability to be self-sufficient, the ability to evaluate and express one's opinions, the ability to self-identify and self-assess in the direction of one's own professional orientation, the ability to respond flexibly to changes in the labour market.  © 2022 IEEE."
"Education in the 21st century: STEM, creativity and critical thinking","Berry A.; Buntting C.; Corrigan D.; Gunstone R.; Jones A.","2022","Education in the 21st Century: STEM, Creativity and Critical Thinking","2","Book","EN","This book explores a range of issues central to STEM and 21st Century education. It explores research into the relationships between creativity, critical thinking and STEM Education from both a theoretical and practical perspective. It examines matters associated with three main concerns: First is the ways some research and development that is labelled ""STEM"" appears to be essentially one of the specific individual components, S, T, E or M, with a new label rather than something going across and/or beyond these more traditional components. The second, at times intertwining, concern is the common ways in which school curriculum continues to hold separate disciplines as its core. The third concern is that while cross-curriculum goals are increasingly common in this century - particularly for ""creativity"" and ""critical thinking"" - it is also common that the goals remain only vaguely linked with the more usual components of the whole curriculum. This book reflects on all three of these important concerns and the integrated whole that can result from them. Monash University, King's College London and Waikato University have now generated six edited books on successive related research issues of significance to contemporary science education. Each of these books has been substantially shaped by a writing workshop involving all authors in intensive discussion about drafts of their contributions (a process of great worth in its own right, as well as for enhancing the value of the final volume), and then each author reworking the contribution in the light of the discussions The seventh will extend beyond science education and explore a range of issues central to STEM and 21st Century education. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

"Towards a signature pedagogy for design and technology education: a literature review","McLain M.","2022","International Journal of Technology and Design Education","21","Article","EN","Drawing on the work of Lee Shulman, this article reviews literature exploring the concept of signature pedagogies, which are described as having have surface, deep and implicit structures. These structures are complex and changing; concerned with habits of head, hand and heart. Emerging from professional education and now being explored in STEM and Humanities education, they are characteristic forms of teaching and learning that are common across a sector. Common themes emerge from within a range of disciplines including art, built environment, design, music, religious, social work and teacher education. These include the roles of the curriculum, the teacher, the learning environment, as well as capability, uncertainty and the challenges associated with signature pedagogies. Focusing on literature from design education, the paper explores the nature of signature pedagogy in design and technology, as a tool for professional discourse. The conclusions propose a discursive framework for design and technology education in which the structures are tied together by the three fundamental activities of ideating, realising and critiquing; more commonly thought of as designing, making and evaluating. The deep structure being project-based learning, undergirded by the implicit values and attitudes associated with design thinking; including collaboration, creativity, empathy, iteration and problem solving. Design and technology education has something unique to offer the broad and balanced curriculum through its signature pedagogies and the way that knowledge is experienced by learners. © 2021, The Author(s)."

However, arts are often marginal and neglected in STEAM education. We conducted semi-structured interviews with eleven STEAM experts in Taiwan regarding their perspectives on and the factors affecting art elements, and suggestions for enhancing STEAM art elements. Thematic analysis of the results confirmed the three art elements we proposed (arts/aesthetic, contextual understanding, and creativity) but with slight modifications. Four categories comprising of 10 strategies emerged for incorporating the art elements in STEAM activities: basic principles (constraining, interaction), arts/aesthetic (arts/aesthetic learning, intention and meaning), contextual understanding (reflection of the socio-cultural context, human-centred design), and creativity (less is more, hands-on exploration, imagination, game-based/collaborative approach). The strategies that emerged in our study can help researchers and educators develop STEAM activities with rich art elements and activate in-depth discussions of STEM concepts. Furthermore, we established that learners’ emotional experiences might be stimulated by art elements, so instructors could further expand their interest in STEM content. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

This chapter explores this approach in pre-school and grades 1 and 2 of primary school (ages 6–8), and examines how creative use of technologies is related to various learning areas in young students’ learning projects. We present 13 interdisciplinary projects in which invention pedagogy, a Finnish approach to STEAM education, was implemented. Invention pedagogy emphasizes the learning of twenty-first century competencies through multidisciplinary, creative, technology-enhanced design and creative processes. Three data sets (i.e., teachers’ project plans, descriptions and reflections) and visual representations of the projects, were analyzed with qualitative content analysis and co-occurrence network analysis. The findings indicate that young students are able use various technological activities representing five technological dimensions: crafting, design, engineering, documenting and sharing, and programming. The underlying connections between the activities and implemented learning areas revealed three orientations to STEAM education: the maker orientation, competence orientation, and digital orientation. These orientations represent varying emphases of young students’ STEAM education and suggest new directions for further developing the approach. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."
"We game on skyscrapers: the effects of an equity-informed game design workshop on students’ computational thinking skills and perceptions of computer science","Çakır N.A.; Çakır M.P.; Lee F.J.","2021","Educational Technology Research and Development","10","Article","EN","This paper presents a game-design workshop built around a digital art installation featuring video games displayed over a real-world skyscraper to stimulate students' interest in computer science and a study testing its short-term effects on improving middle school students' computational thinking (CT) skills and attitudes towards computing. Following a STEAM approach, the workshop aimed to engage participants in age-appropriate activities that focus on CT skills through the lens of creating their own game. A web-based game design interface that allows students to code and play games as simulated on a skyscraper was developed to support the workshop's core activities. The web environment also featured step-by-step tutorials and fully functional games to promote the accessibility of the learning materials for a diverse body of students and educators around the globe. The results of the study indicated that the workshop helped students improve their CT skills and differentially influence their attitudes towards computing. In particular, the workshop experience led students from underserved community districts to lower their attitude ratings, whereas the reverse pattern was observed for students from more affluent districts. The workshop reportedly informed students' perception of computing as a profession and their appreciation of the analytical effort required for developing functional games. Qualitative analysis of artifact-based interviews indicated that students could begin to make abstractions and devise algorithms by associating variables through conditional statements while solving problems related to game development. Interview analysis also revealed that students took pride in the effort that they made during the workshop. © 2021, Association for Educational Communications and Technology."

Firstly, the Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics (STEAM) educational model is comprehensively discussed. Then, the current situation and difficulties of EN grammar teaching in high school are analyzed. Finally, based on the traditional and the STEAM teaching mode, a comprehensive study on the psychological motivation of students is carried out in high school EN grammar teaching. The traditional teaching model had little effect on students’ psychological motivation in the process of EN grammar teaching. Therefore, students’ satisfaction with EN grammar teaching under the traditional teaching model is very low, especially in innovation and practice. The STEAM teaching model has greatly improved the psychological motivation of high school students in the EN grammar teaching process. The overall satisfaction rate of the students with the EN grammar teaching in the STEAM teaching model is 70%. This teaching model can greatly improve students’ requirements for innovation and practice. This study not only provides a reference for the improvement of EN teaching in high schools but also contributes to the reform and development of education. Copyright © 2022 Lin."

Thus, we designed a conceptual framework on parent-assisted remote teaching with active uses of educational technology supported by cycles of design-based research. After a previous study utilizing computer-aided design (CAD) software and three-dimensional (3D) printing in primary education, we used our initial findings to work with 12 early childhood students (ages 4–6), together with their teachers and parents in the second remote teaching period in Luxembourg. We created a STEAM modeling task with CAD software on robots and collected data through chat responses, messageboards, and online communication channels during a 3-week period. Here, we observed new roles in the parent–child relationship while learning STEAM in remote teaching with technology, and new opportunities in using educational technology overall in early childhood education. In this article, we have described findings that are likely to influence students’ learning and parent-assisted teaching, in particular parents and students’ perceptions and motivations, together with the way in which parents provide technical knowledge and support in remote early childhood STEAM education.

"Exploring competing perspectives on how to design open innovation program for high school stem education: A case study","Lee S.Y.; Jung M.","2021","Education Sciences","7","Article","EN","Open innovation (OI) has become an essential business model for big tech companies and innovation ecosystems. However, most STEM high schools in the United States do not have appro-priate OI programs for students. This paper explores how various perspectives on open innovation as an emerging trend in the entrepreneurial ecosystem can link with STEM education programs. We use the Q methodology technique with interviews from students and managers of STEM education at C Academy and academic members from a field of open innovation. Twenty-three participants responded to the 35 Q statements derived from preliminary findings of critical issues on a relationship between open innovation and STEM education. Five key perspectives compete, each with a unique view on why STEM education matters and how to renovate the current STEM program for an open innovation-based curriculum and club activities inside and outside high schools. Empirical findings from Q method analysis combined with Promax rotation illustrate five views: (1) civic vir-tue-driven open innovation, (2) open innovation with imagination from arts and culture, (3) daily life-based open innovation project, (4) critics on conventional STEM education, and (5) community service-driven open innovation. A common area that all five perspectives support is that the gov-ernment should expand and strengthen support in the design and operation of open innovation education programs in STEM high schools. © 2021 by the authors.

"Solving the creativity crisis: The critical need for professional development in maker-centered teaching","Bressler D.M.","2022","Research Anthology on Makerspaces and 3D Printing in Education","0","Book chapter","EN","Society's serious problems require creative thinkers. Developing an effective workforce relies on cultivating our children's creativity. Unfortunately, we are suffering a creativity crisis, particularly with young children. Since 1990, early elementary students have suffered the largest decrease in creative thinking capacity. Rather than learning through play, young children are taught by rote and tested extensively. Play is indispensable for early learners; without play, students are missing an essential element of early learning that stimulates creative thinking. To promote play, elementary teachers should be trained in maker-centered teaching, a playful approach to learning that embodies the essential elements of STEM education. To truly integrate maker-centered learning, there is a critical need for effective maker-centered professional development. Maker-centered teaching provides playful learning where young children can experience STEM and learn to think more creatively. With maker-centered teaching, we can make the next generation of innovators. © 2022, IGI Global. All rights reserved."
"eLuna: A Co-Design Framework for Narrative Digital Game-Based Learning that Support STEAM","Breien F.; Wasson B.","2022","Frontiers in Education","10","Article","EN","STEAM education enables the cross-curricular study of subjects based on their naturally occurring relationships through holistic and integrated methods. Narratives are enablers of STEAM learning environments, something that is evident in the exploration of narrative learning from pre-recorded history until present. Narrative Digital Game-Based Learning (DGBL) use narratives to drive the game. The extended Ludo Narrative Variable Model (the Variable Model) is a narratological model for categorization of narrative DGBL. Empirical evidence from categorizing narrative DGBL on the Variable Model shows that there is a particular set of categories that incur positive effects on engagement, motivation, and learning. This article introduces the eLuna co-design framework that builds on these categories and empowers educators to participate alongside game developers in multidisciplinary design and development of narrative DGBL. eLuna comprises 1) a four-phase co-design method, and 2) a visual language to support the co-design and co-specification of the game to a blueprint that can be implement by game developers. Idun’s Apples, a narrative DGBL co-designed, co-specified, and implemented into a prototype using eLuna, is presented to illustrate the use of the method and visual language. Arguing that narrative DGBL are vessels for STEAM learning, seven eLuna co-designed games are examined to illustrate that they support STEAM. The article concludes that narrative DGBL co-designed using the eLuna framework provide high opportunity and potential for supporting STEAM, providing educators and game developers with a STEAM co-design framework that enforces positive effects on engagement, motivation, and learning.

"Developing the Spatial Skills of Neurodiverse Students","Sorby S.A.; Stark S.; Carnahan C.","2022","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings","0","Conference paper","EN","Individuals with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities and/or Autism (IwD) are among the smallest group of individuals with disabilities attending college. However, as these individuals exit our school systems, they are increasingly seeking both postsecondary education opportunities and competitively paid employment in STEM fields. Unfortunately, while options are improving, access to STEM related post-secondary education and employment remain limited. IwD often experience learning and communication challenges that manifest as difficulties related to executive function and social relationships. Thus, individuals are likely to experience unique challenges that make adjusting to postsecondary and employment settings difficult. Investigating creative education solutions for IwD that support both the development of STEM skills necessary for employment and also promote critical thinking and problem-solving skills is one possible way to address the unique challenges presented by an untapped talent pool and the low employment rates of the group. One approach that may prove promising for increasing STEM education and employment opportunities for IwD is spatial visualization skills instruction, and some research suggests such an approach may also be beneficial for IwD. This research team implemented two pilot studies to explore: 1) how a curriculum designed for improving the spatial skills of first-year engineering students contributes to the development of spatial skills for IwD; 2) what modifications are needed to make the curriculum more accessible for IwD; 3) what are the limitations or benefits of virtual versus in-person teaching for this particular population; and 4) what are the perceptions of IwD regarding the curriculum and their capacity for success in STEM. Results from this pilot work, although limited, indicate IwD can improve spatial visualization skills through exposure to the curriculum. This paper includes results from two pilot studies and discusses plans for expanding the scope of this work in the future, including expanding the intervention to include CAD instruction, in partnership with Siemens, to develop a STEM career pathway for IwD. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022"

By positioning youth as inventors, invention educators can engage learners in the dynamic process of innovation, surrounding and anchoring them in an authentic user-centered experience that focuses on empathy building. In invention-based programs, youth learners create products applying STEM knowledge and skills to enhance conditions and/or the quality of life of a particular user. What educators teach and expect youth to do as inventors is different at every grade level (elementary, middle, and high school). Nonetheless, when educators position youth to invent, they co-create a hybrid space that favors youth to become agents of change. In these learning spaces, youth enact their agency by identifying a problem, researching the problem from many points of view, and identifying novel and unique ways to solve the problem. The resulting invention is designed for a particular user but is also pertinent to a particular community and multiple users within the community. Reciprocally, the inventor gains practical knowledge and social skills within the opportunity to invent. We argue that Invention Education promotes responsive and transformative learning by positioning youth as agents of change. This paper aims to identify and define elements of Invention Education that strongly resonate with the Next Generation Science Standards and STEM education policy, culturally responsive teaching practices, and community-based partnerships.

Therefore, the aims of the research are both to (a) reveal the effect of the STEM workshop on science teachers’ awareness of the relationship between science and other disciplines and to (b) examine its transferring contribution to their lesson planning approach. The case study method was used to get the essential data of research with 40 science teachers. The data were gathered via the Questionnaire for Interdisciplinary Association of Science, the lesson plans, and semi-structured interviews. As a result of the research, less variation is found in disciplines associated with science such as mathematics, technology-design, social studies, engineering, visual arts, Turkish languages, and music, etc. compared to data tools that they applied before and after workshop sessions. Besides, the post-applied data tool results revealed that the participants provided more comprehensive explanations regarding the direction of the interdisciplinary association, which suggests a better understanding of the relationship of science with other disciplines in the latter case.

In practice, it is possible to consider this integrative framework as cross-disciplinary, multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, or transdisciplinary dependent upon the educational objectives. On the one hand, schools may consider that STEAM education leads to students' innovative thinking and contributing to society's workforce development goals. On the other hand, STEAM education can be focused on creativity, self-expression, and empathy, which can lead to self-realization and fulfillment. Currently, K-12 settings are the primary users of this framework, shaping the curricular activities, exploring new ways to integrate these five disciplines, and researching the content, pedagogy, and assessment related to this field. However, at undergraduate or graduate levels, this framework has been little explored. This research seeks to understand faculty members' perception as a factor that may prevent the extensive use of STEAM education by undergraduate and graduate engineering education levels. In that sense, this pilot study focused on exploring how two of the STEAM areas, engineering and art, faculty members from a Large Midwestern University perceive engineering, art, and their integration. This study used Moscovici's and Abric's Social Representation theory, looking for the core and peripheric attitudes and information that faculty participants have regarding the integration of engineering and arts.

This article presents a systematic review of the teacher training process, in undergraduate courses, in the face of digital technologies in the contemporary world. The objective was to systematize the scientific evidences and interconnections that reflect in the curriculum field the technological competences for teacher training, implying a new professional profile, in order to profile critical, creative, innovative and dynamic teachers. METHOD. For data generation, a search was conducted in the Scopus and Proquest database using the key phrase “teacher training in technologies”, in Portuguese, ES and EN languages, and articles published between 2015 and 2021, in the theme of social sciences. The PRISMA flowchart was used. In this sense, it aims to support the questions: what is the scientific evidence on teacher training in digital technologies? What technological resources are used to develop teaching competences? What are the main recommendations of the authors for future training processes? RESULTS. The results reveal four subcategories of analysis: a) use of digital platforms or resources; b) pedagogical practices; c) learning and content development; d) policies, training and curricula. Although technologies have been incorporated as a mediating element in the teaching and learning process, they still appear incipiently in teacher training courses DISCUSSION. According to what has been analyzed, it should be considered that it is important to implement in the curriculum references related to knowledge, knowhow and technological skills. CONCLUSIONS. In addition, the research points to the need to correlate the implementation of educational policies, teacher training, the use of digital resources and the development of curricula that reinforce the knowledge of the use of technology to develop skills to incorporate technological practices in educational practice. © Sociedad Española de Pedagogía."

"The development of autonomous student learning networks: Patterns of interactions in an open world learning environment for teachers exploring teaching with and through computer science","Ardito G.; Czerkawski B.","2021","Sustainability (Switzerland)","3","Article","EN","This pilot case study sought to investigate patterns of interactions between learners and their instructor in a teacher education course called “Computer Science for Teachers”. This course was constructed to leverage aspects of open world game design elements in order to investigate the effects of degrees of autonomy in gameplay/learning. This course was conducted in a specially built social learning platform based on Elgg software. Student interactions with the instructor and other students in this course were analyzed to determine the learning networks students constructed during each key learning activity as well as the epistemic spaces defined by these interactions. Descriptive statistics along with social network analysis (SNA) and epistemic network analysis (ENA) were used to investigate these data. The findings indicate that more traditional/less open world gaming type learning activities were associated with learning networks and epistemic spaces that were teacher-centered and narrower, while more open world gaming/high levels of autonomy (student-centric) learning activities were associated with learning networks that were highly decentralized and epistemic spaces that featured students asking and answering questions of/for one another. These findings were consistent with existing research into player behavior in open world type games and learner behavior in settings with high levels of autonomy support. Implications for further research are discussed. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

In this study, we call the describing models “UML programming.” In this paper, we show an educational UML programming environment for science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics (STEAM) related subjects (especially for Technology or Engineering) in schools, which are able to apply from elementary school to university. At first, we explain why, what, and how doing the UML programming. In this study, we use a state machine diagram for UML programming. To draw this model, the students just put some states in rectangular shape and transitions in arrow shape. Two types of educational model notations in state machine diagram are introduced. Then, some advanced functions of the SRPS are described. They are an educational model editor, and management of users, learning tasks and models submitted by students. Next, two case studies with the SRPS are shown. One case study is adopted to the summer camp for 5th- and 6th-grade students. The participants were 20 students and were engaged in 4 hours workshop. We used a car-type robot with two DC motors, a one-touch sensor, and one infrared sensor connected to a micro:bit. The other case study is a formal technology class at one JP public junior high school. One teacher and five classes worked on UML programming for traffic lights. Each class had 20 9th-grade students. One student at this school was given a traffic light robot with three Light-emitting diode (LED) lights, a one-touch sensor, and one infrared sensor connected to a micro:bit. Finally, on the basis of these two case studies using our environment, we discuss the potential for innovative STEAM education with UML programming. © 2022 Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Cognition and Exploratory Learning in the Digital Age, CELDA 2022.

"Flourishing Effects of Integrating the Arts and Humanities in STEM Education: A Review of Past Studies and an Agenda for Future Research","Vaziri H.; Bradburn N.M.","2022","The Oxford Handbook of the Positive Humanities","1","Book chapter","EN","With growing interest and emphasis on science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) within society, scholars and educators have proposed the inclusion of the arts and humanities into STEM education (i.e., STEAM) with the premise that such an interdisciplinary approach to education would further enhance students’ retention, learning, and flourishing. While the literature on student retention and learning outcomes is fruitful, less attention has been paid to the flourishing effects of STEAM education. Accordingly, the purpose of this chapter is to provide a systematic review of the literature on STEAM education and flourishing outcomes (i.e., subjective and psychological well-being, character and virtue, and creativity).

The study research questions are: (1) ""In which competences do the participants perceive a personal improvement during the programme?"", and (2) ""Can we identify a profile of the candidates most suited to take better advantage of the training?"". The study includes current participants and students who have completed the program in the last 5 years. A mixed research methodology was used including both quantitative and qualitative analysis. Data from the program alumni and current candidates have been quantitatively analysed to identify common personal and background features among them. Structured interviews and focus groups have been conducted to find out how their initial expectations matched with their perception of what was offered in the program. The qualitative interviews include a discussion about their experiences along the programme and their ambitions for their further professional development, and put in context with their specific background. This research has important implications for the future, such as the need for increased training in digital skills. The majority of the teachers surveyed have a positive impression of the training and are in the middle of their careers. However, because of the pressure to satisfy other Academia requirements, many potential applicants in their early career stages do not complete or even contemplate participating in the program. © 2022 SEFI 2022 - 50th Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education, Proceedings.

"A Quarter Century of Minorities in Engineering: Design, Development and Team Teaching of Institutional Core Curricula","Golding P.; Golding D.E.; Navar C.A.J.","2021","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings","1","Conference paper","EN","We have been teaching Institutional core curricula courses at The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) since 1996. The course curricula, sources, and most relevant, the innovations in teaching each course have impacted STEM student success and learning. The Texas Core Curriculum (TCC) is defined by the Texas Education Code (TEC) Section 61.821 as:... ""the curriculum in liberal arts, humanities, and sciences and political, social, and cultural history that all undergraduate students of an institution of higher education are required to complete before receiving an academic undergraduate degree."" Texas Senate Bill (SB) 148, passed by the 75th Texas Legislature in January 1997, repealed previous legislation concerning either lower-division transfer or core curriculum and sought to resolve concerns regarding the transfer of lower-division course credit among Texas public colleges and universities while maintaining the core curriculum as one of the fundamental components of a high-quality undergraduate educational experience. More recent sessions of the Texas Legislature have fine-tuned the existing laws regarding the core curriculum, but the essentials of the statutes have not changed since 1997. UTEP selected the specific courses that it offers to fulfill that framework of the UCC, taking into account the individual role and mission of our Minority Serving institution. The UCC implementation at our institution requires we gain approval from the certifying body for the university's state. All institutions in the state must evaluate the effectiveness of their UCC at regular intervals. Our teaching methods and content has evolved such that the institution's component courses and pedagogies of Team Teaching are vital to achieving the desired outcomes. Our model is an ""all in"" team endeavor; our instructional team meets with all classes, and such is an enterprising dynamic, engaging faculty, staff, and near-peer teachers, working together. Modeling teamwork is a core attribution of our approach. Research-to-practice becomes practice-to-research as we learn new ways to help our students succeed while growing their preparedness for future success in their degree aspirations. Our sharing focuses on entering students and Juniors. All students in the university take these courses: STEM students learn discourse and liberal arts critical thinking, and non-STEM students learn the value of sciences, (big) data, and scientific analyses. One of the most important provisions of the UCC is that it allows students who successfully complete core curriculum courses at one institution to transfer (up to) the entire set of completed courses to another public institution of higher education without the need to repeat any core courses. Students who transfer without completing the whole (42-SCH) core curriculum also receive credit for each of the core courses they satisfy. Although the studies included in the CUC may vary by institution, every higher education institution's core curriculum in our state must consist of 6-SCH of Foundational Component Areas. These courses are the focus of our sharing. A final segment of our work is designing the latest core course, which includes an emphasis on innovation and leadership engineering. Thus, the newest part of our work is developing the latest core course, emphasizing innovation and leadership engineering. The course arises as a natural outgrowth of our work and the changes in society and STEM education necessary to promote lifelong learning. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021"
"Engineering Ethics Through High-Impact Collaborative/Competitive Scenarios (E-ETHICCS)","Streiner S.; Burkey D.D.; Young M.F.; Cimino R.T.; Pascal J.","2021","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings","9","Conference paper","EN","Engineering grand challenges increasingly involve numerous social and ethical considerations that transcend the technical skills that dominate traditional engineering education. Engineering solutions often have major, long-lasting impacts on society. Since the process of technical innovation occurs in increasingly complex social exchanges, engineers are frequently confronted with social and ethical dilemmas in their professional lives. How do students acquire the skills needed to tackle these problems? The authors hypothesize that placing engineering challenges and solutions in a classroom context while emphasizing social engagement and impact facilitates the development of engineering students as moral agents who understand the consequences of their decisions. Thus, a collaboration of investigators from the grantee universities are investigating how game-based educational interventions with strongly situated components influence early-curriculum engineering students' ethical awareness and decision making. This paper offers an overview of the progress to date of this three year, NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) grant that aims to (1) characterize the ethical awareness and decision making of first-year engineering students, (2) develop game-based learning interventions focused on ethical decision making, and (3) determine how (and why) game-based approaches affect students' ethical awareness in engineering and the advantages of such approaches over non game-based approaches. Results from this investigation will offer the engineering education community insight into how engineering students approach problem solving through the lens of ethical reasoning and decision making, potentially transforming an often overlooked part of engineering curricula for decades to come. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021"

A study with 71 middle school students compared three different devices (laptop, Mobile VR, Head-Mounted-Display) regarding their induced levels of presence and resulting learning outcomes. The findings show 1) a strong effect of the virtual environment for the intended learning objectives, 2) a higher level of technological immersion does not automatically lead to higher learning outcomes, and 3) a positive correlation between presence and learning outcomes.

Not only it develops learners' physical competence and health fitness, but also provides a blended learning and teaching environment to actualize ""STEM"" (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) concepts through various physical and sports activities. Learners are encouraged to strengthen their integration and application of knowledge and skills so as to nurture their curiosity in learning, creativity and innovation, and develop critical thinking, collaboration and problem solving skills, which are the essential skills and qualities required in the 21st Century. Approach: Designing the STEMe and CLM innovative learning management lesson plans indicated the processing and resulting efficiency qualities (E1/E2) was threshold of the standardized criterion at 80/80. Designing the 30-item Movement Skills Assessment (MSA), and the 20-Analytical Thinking Skills Assessment (ATSA) instruments were assessed students’ movement and analytical thinking skills. These instruments are valid and reliable. Purpose: Creative the pre-test-post-test-design method was examined the effects of STEM education (STEMe) and conventional learning management (CLM) on physical education learning core to integrate movement activities on movement and analytical thinking skills of 66 lower secondary students at the grade 8th level from Srisuriyathai Female School, Thailand. To divide 33-experimental STEMe group and 33-CLM-control group was compared. Results: The CLM lesson showed the E1/E2 as 79.67/78.00, and the STEMe showed as 88.10/86.50 that higher than the standardized criterion at 80/80. Comparisons between pre-and post-test for the control and experimental groups of their MSA and ATSA are differences, significantly (p<.01) and the classified levels are neither satisfied nor dissatisfied and somewhat levels for the pre-test and post-test. The STEMe was differentiated significantly (p<.001) and the classified levels indicated that of neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, and very satisfied levels for the pre-and post-test-MSA-ATSA, respectively. The ATSA and the MSA instruments were relative significantly, when using a simple correlation analysis (r) and standardized regression validity (β). The multiple correlations (R) and the efficient determination predictive efficiency (R2) value indicated that 41% and 66% of the variances in students’ analytical thinking skills of the control and experimental groups were attributable to their post MSA learning assessment to their physical education environmental classes. Conclusions: It provides a measure of how well observed outcomes are replicated by the STEM education method, based on the proportion of total variation of students’ learning outcomes explained by the STEM Education instructional model is better than the conventional instruction management, differently. © JPES."

This paper contributes to this line of research by reporting on a two-wave quantitative study that examines the effect of a long-term STEAM intervention on two cognitive processes associated with creativity (act, flow) and their interrelationships with intrinsic and extrinsic components of science motivation. Using pre- and post-survey data from 175 high-school students in Italy, results show an overall positive effect of the intervention both on the act subscale of creativity and science career motivation, whereas a negative effect is found on self-efficacy. Gender differences in the above effects are also observed. Further, results provide support for the mediating role of self-efficacy in the relationship between creativity and science career motivation.

How will we provide children with the skills they will need in the future? While early years education has been traditionally strong in supporting twenty-first century skills like creativity, collaboration and problem-solving within play, global crises around the ecological, social and economic sustainability of our societies challenge current practices and call on us as researchers and educators to rethink how these and other skills, like computational thinking, could be advanced in early childhood education via science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM) education. Over recent years, the Finnish educational system has enjoyed intense national and international attention, the early childhood education and care (ECEC) sector along with it. This has resulted in multiple descriptions and attempts to characterize Finnish education’s main differences from other national systems. Finnish early years education has been heralded for its holistic orientation to children’s care and education, as well as its focus on playful learning approaches and participatory culture. However, despite these positive characterizations and the arguably great potential of the Finnish pre-primary education for offering children with rich opportunities to engage in STEAM learning, early childhood educators are still cautious in implementing STEAM and phenomenon-based learning. In this chapter, we present three distinctive approaches to early STEAM education developed in Finland, namely (1) phenomenon-based learning, (2) children’s maker spaces and (3) children’s projects. In addition, we also discuss how these approaches build on the current form of Finnish ECEC and draw out suggestions on how these approaches could potentially address the above concerns regarding Finnish early years STEAM education. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022."

The Industry Hothousing variant of CPS is an intensive, time-constrained workshop-based process to build mutual trust between customers and industry experts in order to synergically develop creative solutions. The main objective of this research is to determine whether and how Hothousing might be used in schools for developing Collaborative Problem Solving and then promoting industry skills. In particular, we seek to establish the degree of structure and support required to unleash student creativity and enhance learning, and the benefits to students and teachers in learning, cross-curricular applicability and time savings. Hothousing for students is based on an intensive series of workshops including face-to-face and on-line collaboration supported by a facilitator. It is student-driven and addresses an open-ended challenge such as: how do I get my friends to love STEAM? Three collaborative problem-solving case studies were examined with different groups of students. Concerning the degree of structure and support, the analyses revealed that student-led intensive collaboration within a trusted framework drives creativity, and it was a good opportunity to experience real life challenges. Positive benefits to students and teachers were the development of technology skills, and Personal Learning and Thinking Skills (PLTS) as well as the enhancement perception of self and STEAM education.

The arts component is called out to promote creative and innovative thinking among STEM learners. As with any novel educational trend, STEAM (science, technology, engineering, the arts, and mathematics) teaching and learning methods have been predominantly developing in the offline settings, especially given the creative nature, softness, and tacitness of learning goals brought in by the arts. However, this global digitalization trend which has been further enforced by the Covid-19 pandemic has pushed the entire educational field to online spaces and STEAM studies had to follow. Given the relative novelty of STEAM, as well as the new normal of online settings that it has to adapt to, our knowledge and understanding of how STEAM studies will survive the shift to the digital era remain very limited. In this study, we analyze the case of a STEAM-based study program on innovation, which was conceptualized as an offline program before the pandemic and had to transform into a fully online format following the global lockdown. Applying the Community of Inquiry (COI) pedagogical framework we analyze in depth the perspectives of all the course participants—students, teachers, and administrative staff—their experiences, their adaptation to the shift into an online space and the lessons learned. Our study shares theoretical, practical, and policymaking implications on STEAM teaching and learning. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022."

"Possibilities and Challenges of Using Educational Cheminformatics for STEM Education: A SWOT Analysis of a Molecular Visualization Engineering Project","Pernaa J.","2022","Journal of Chemical Education","15","Article","EN","This perspective paper analyses the possibilities and challenges of using cheminformatics as a context for STEM education. The objective is to produce theoretical insights through a SWOT analysis of an authentic educational cheminformatics project where future chemistry teachers engineered a physical 3D model using cheminformatics software and a 3D printer. In this article, engineering is considered as the connective STEM component binding technology (cheminformatics software and databases), science (molecular visualizations), and mathematics (graph theory) together in a pedagogically meaningful whole. The main conclusion of the analysis is that cheminformatics offers great possibilities for STEM education. It is a solution-centered research field that produces concrete artifacts such as visualizations, software, and databases. This is well-suited to STEM education, enabling an engineering-based approach that ensures students' active and creative roles. The main challenge is a high content knowledge demand, derived from the multidisciplinary nature of cheminformatics. This challenge can be solved via training and collaborative learning environment design. Although the work with educational cheminformatics is still in its infancy, it seems a highly promising context for supporting chemistry learning via STEM education. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

In this work-in-progress we examine the relationship between algorithms and culture and present a novel gaming experience for youth to engage in algorithmic literacy practices. While there are many opportunities for learners to engage in computer science education, we found that educators often feel underprepared to engage in teaching algorithmic literacy practices. Additionally, we identify there is a need for more educational content that introduces ethical dilemmas related to the use of algorithms to collect, track and sort data to make decisions about who gets access to certain opportunities. Screening Bot is a narrative-driven sandbox game in which learners play the role of a policing bot in charge of monitoring access to a space habitat which provides better living conditions for populations across the galaxy. While learners create algorithms to determine who enters the new habitat, they will find out that even the best algorithms can be subject to bias. This game will invite learners and educators to examine current bias in algorithmic models and help them become more reflective about the tensions related to algorithms in their lives. © 2021 Owner/Author."

A future-oriented education on critical issues, such as those outlined in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) and designing potential solutions for such problems is an imperative skill that must be imparted to children to help them navigate their future in today's unpredictable world. Towards this goal, we have been conducting 3.5 month-long mentoring sessions for pre-university students in India to participate in a STEAM for Social Good innovation challenge conducted annually by the Government of India. Using digital and physical computing skills, we helped children explore creative solutions for social problems through a constructionist approach to learning, wherein they ideated and reflected upon the problems in their communities. The children learnt the Engineering Design Thinking process and worked in online groups of two or three, from concept to completion. Despite the constraints posed by the pandemic, they explored creative ways to think about design and innovation. They completed a variety of tasks by making, tinkering, engineering, assembling, and programming to grasp the intricate relationship between software and hardware. Subsequently, the children showcased their creative abilities through video storytelling to a panel of domain experts. In this paper, we present the children's perspective of their experiences through this journey, the evaluation metrics based on IEEE design principles, and our learnings from conducting this initiative as a university-school partnership model for 84 middle and high school students. The aspirational intent of this initiative is to make the children better social problem solvers and help them perceive social problems as opportunities to enhance life for themselves and their communities. © 2022 IEEE."
"What is Next for Africa’s Youthful and Useful Population? STREAM Education for Global Inclusivity","Badmus O.T.; Jita L.C.","2022","Journal of Culture and Values in Education","1","Article","EN","The world is a global village today undoubtedly due to advances in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines and their education. The knowledge from these disciplines influences various aspects of human daily affairs, career choices and the type of education acquired by citizens. STEM literature across the world has put Africa at the tail end of development. Africa’s underdevelopment may not be argued owing to empirical literature in the direction of poor development. However, the global demand for competence in STEM disciplines continues to rise at a rate developed countries find difficult to keep up due to shortage of man power as against demands. This surge in demand creates a gap that must be filled in pursuit of sustainable growth. Science, technology, robotics, engineering, the arts and mathematics (STREAM) education remains obscure among countries in Africa, with the paradigm shift to aesthetics with arts and automation in robotics globally calling for redirection in developing regions. South African and Nigerian curricula have been moderated to accommodate coding and robotics as well as physics in technology, with green energy and elementary automation, respectively.

The research employed a qualitative descriptive and phenomenological design and a typical case sampling method, which is a purposive sampling technique. The study group of the research consisted of 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th-year prospective teachers at two education faculties of state universities in Turkey, Departments of Primary Education, Social Sciences and Turkish Education, Foreign Languages, Mathematics and Science Education, Computer and Instructional Technologies Education, Educational Sciences, and Fine Arts Education. Data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire and analyzed with content analysis. Participants preferred the teaching profession mostly because of individual reasons, such as their own choice or being interested in the field. Another reason following these reasons was ""self-identification"". According to the participants' views, the teaching profession was characterized by being both a male and female profession (not identifying gender; loving the profession; being talented), being a profession appropriate for females (working hours suitable for females; identifying females with the profession; being compassionate and patient; being aesthetical and polite; and low salary), being a profession appropriate for males (establishing authority in the classroom; being natural; identifying females with the profession due to the lack of knowledge), and considering the job as a male or female profession depending on the situation.

"A Preliminary Exploration of Second Specialty Teachers’ Motivation, Curricular Consciousness Construction and Teaching Practices in Living Technology Education","Fan S.-C.; Chen C.-Y.","2021","Journal of Research in Education Sciences","0","Article","Chinese","Background Technology education plays an increasingly vital role in ensuring students’ technological literacy under the new Curriculum Guidelines of 12-Year Basic Education, which was introduced in 2019. However, because of the low importance assigned to living technology courses, most schools do not have sufficient qualified teachers in this field. This poses a hurdle in the implementation of the technology curriculum of Taiwan’s 12-year basic education. Moreover, because of declining birthrates, many teachers have no students to teach and the number of teachers in junior high schools have consequently shrunk. The Ministry of Education established a second-specialty course to provide teachers with a second professional certificate to meet the teaching needs of schools. Living technology is based on hands-on learning, problem-solving, and design thinking. Therefore, in addition to the conceptual knowledge of technology and engineering, living technology teachers should possess diverse practical skills and engineering design thinking and problem-solving abilities. Unlike other traditional disciplines, the living technology course attaches great importance to practical hands-on skills for solving technical problems, which is a major challenge faced by teachers of the second specialty. On the basis of this background, this research explored different means of helping teachers with second specialty to teach living technology more effectively. Purpose The purpose of this study is to explore the transformation of teachers, who have taken the second specialty course in living technology. These teachers’ motivation, beliefs, curricular awareness construction, and teaching practices were examined. Understanding the dynamic relationship among multiple factors that can be used as a reference for the future promotion of teacher training and professional development in the field of technology is imperative. Theoretical Framework The theoretical framework of the study is based on teachers’ beliefs, curricular consciousness, the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) (Ajzen, 1985, 1991), curricular awareness, and teaching practices. This study evaluated (1) teachers’ motivation to participate in professional development learning and (2) teachers’ curricular consciousness. First, this study investigated teachers’ motivation from the perspective of their beliefs and self-efficacy. Teachers’ self-efficacy refers to their belief in their abilities to teach effectively and is assessed according to whether the students have acquired real knowledge and abilities (Thoonen et al., 2011). When teachers regard teaching as a mission but feel that they lack professional competence and face pressure from changes in the educational environment, they are motivated to invest in continuing education. However, most teachers engage in continuing education because of several motivating factors. Second, teachers’ curriculum consciousness is a dynamic process of awareness. It includes internal reflection, beliefs in their teaching, reflection on curriculum implementation, and interpretation and organization of the environment (Fang & Feng, 2017). Specifically, curricular awareness includes awareness of professional knowledge, awareness of self-beliefs, and awareness of the environment (Chen, 2003; Fang & Feng, 2017; Kung & Lin, 2009). Professional knowledge includes content knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, pedagogical content knowledge, knowledge of the teaching environment, and knowledge of students (Shulman, 1986, 1987). Professional knowledge should have a positive connection with teaching practice, which, in turn, modifies curriculum consciousness. Self-belief awareness refers to the self-evaluation of the results of applying certain teaching activities and teaching strategies. This can be explained in conjunction with the “attitude” aspect of the TPB (Ajzen, 1985, 1991). Environmental factors, such as hardware and software equipment, school culture, parents, and community, may present limitations and challenges to teachers but may also be perceived as opportunities related to the “subjective norm” and “perceived behavior control” factors in the TPB (Ajzen, 1985, 1991). Design/Methods On the basis of a review of the existing literature, this study investigated the factors that affect teachers’ motivation for and effectiveness in participating in a second-specialty course and subsequently constructed the outline of a semi-structured interview. A case study was employed along with semi-structured, in-depth interviews with nine teachers from various junior high schools in southern Taiwan. Both individual and group interviews were conducted. The second-specialty course of living technology started in July 2018. To elucidate the changes in the participants’ curricular consciousness after the second-specialty course, the interviews were conducted after the first stage of the course (following the completion of eleven credits). The interviews, each lasting approximately 60 minutes, were conducted in October 2018. The transcripts of the interviews were imported into NVivo qualitative analysis software, and the data were analyzed through the following steps: First, preliminary coding and classification was conducted on the basis of the aspects of investment motivation, curriculum awareness, teaching practices. Second, two researchers discussed the preliminary inductive findings, identified common or disparate views, and focused on further establishing concepts. Third, the summarized concepts were compared with related literature, and, if necessary, the interviewees were invited to verify the accuracy of the analysis results or provide auxiliary reference materials. Triangulation was used to ensure the validity of the study. Finally, in-depth discussions were held according to the research purpose, and the research findings were summarized. Results The encoding and analysis of the data using NVivo produced the following research findings: (1) The motivation of teachers to participate in the second-specialty course of living technology primarily came from their interest in hands-on implementation and their schools’ teaching needs. All teachers reported that before teaching living technology courses, they believed that this subject involved handicrafts or industrial arts, which they had previously learned. Most knowledge of technology was derived from self-learning and the experience of using technology in daily life. Most of the participants indicated that fully understanding and transforming the subject into teaching activities was difficult. (2) The effect of teachers’ participation in the second-specialty course on the development of their curricular consciousness included the promotion of their professional awareness of living technology courses, the transformation of their beliefs concerning technology education, and the establishment of positive self-awareness regarding teaching living technology. (3) Teaching practice prompted teachers of the second-specialty course to rapidly absorb and transform professional knowledge. However, in the process, their teaching confidence was affected by external environmental factors and a lack of professional knowledge. (4) The support available to teacher communities from inside and outside the school and from the school administration are critical to enabling teachers in the second-specialty course to overcome their teaching difficulties. Conclusion This study explored the transformation of second-specialty teachers involved in technology education, including their motivation, beliefs, curricular awareness construction, and teaching practices. On the basis of a literature review and interview analysis, the researchers proposed a framework to highlight the dynamic relationship between teachers’ curricular consciousness and their teaching practices. The results demonstrated that substantial professional growth occurs between learning in the second-specialty course and teaching living technology in junior high school. Teachers’ learning motivation, knowledge construction, and real-life teaching situations influence each other and affect teachers’ self-awareness, professional awareness, and environmental awareness, respectively. These dynamic interactions help form teachers’ curricular awareness. The interviews revealed that external change factors may motivate teachers to expand their knowledge. However, the most critical factors involve teachers independently generating learning motivation and curricular consciousness and desiring real changes that prompts them to invest in continual learning and teaching practices. Furthermore, teachers must establish their own teaching beliefs and curricular awareness to strengthen their teaching confidence in new fields and face external pressure, which is the core focus of curricular reform. © 2021, National Taiwan Normal University.

These programs have been integral in preparing students to pursue degrees and careers in STEM that meet the needs of a 21st century global economy [3]. In order to address rapid technological growth and our dynamic digital climate, such vital STEM educational opportunities must continuously evolve to provide students the tools necessary for meaningful engagement within a future global workforce.First developed at MIT Sea Grant three decades ago, the SeaPerch program was a novel approach at hands-on project based learning with a STEM curriculum for K-12 audiences. Students built their own remotely operated vehicle (ROV) unit with low-budget materials and learned about concepts such as buoyancy and circuits while being given the opportunity to compete in design challenges that built off the base SeaPerch unit [4].Returning to the roots of the program, MIT Sea Grant is again investing in the fundamental ideas behind SeaPerch by developing SeaPerch II in order to keep up with emerging and even since-established advances in technology. We found soft robotics and Arduino microcontrollers to be the most suitable areas of focus which further increase exposure to STEM topics at the K-12 level. The redesign will include the implementation of tiers in the curriculum, which will help cater to different ages and experience levels. SeaPerch II will emphasize the iterative model of design engineering with opportunities for students to take creative direction by exploring these universal and utile technologies.SeaPerch II will bridge the gap between the previous educational modules of SeaPerch and advances in emerging technologies. Introducing innovative science to students at an earlier age in an accessible, low-cost manner will increase the diversity of STEM programs and will reinforce interest and awareness in pursuing careers in STEM. SeaPerch II serves to inspire the next generation as well as contribute to the decentralization of robotic systems and their dissemination into the public domain.  © 2022 IEEE."

Therefore, there is a trend towards incorporating accessibility in computer science curricula. Many approaches were presented in order to teach accessibility in the academy, however many failed in the department of motivation and engagement. Moreover, gamification is a strong contender when it comes to engaging, motivating and improving the students' performance using game design elements in non-game context, and it has not been much explored to teach accessibility in the academy. Consequently, this paper proposes to teach accessibility in the academy through a gamification-based approach.

"Cultivating a Design Thinking Mindset in Educationally Disadvantaged Students Using a Design-based Activity","Ladachart L.; Khamlarsai S.; Phothong W.","2022","International Journal of Innovation in Science and Mathematics Education","3","Article","EN","Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, as an educational policy, provides opportunities for students to learn these disciplines in more integrated ways than traditional methods. This can be pedagogically accomplished via a design-based approach where students engage collaboratively in solving engineering problems using various domains of knowledge and skills. In this pedagogical process, design thinking is vital. However, little is known about whether students develop this kind of thinking and its mindset when engaging in design-based activities. The purpose of this study is to examine the influence of a design-based activity on design thinking. Participants included 18 ninth-grade students in a small rural school. The data were collected using a Likert-scale questionnaire before and after the design-based activity, in combination with classroom observations and focus group interviews with the students. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to analyse the quantitative data and a thematic analysis method was utilised for the qualitative data. The results indicate that the students were significantly more comfortable with solving engineering problems, even though other aspects of design thinking mindset (e.g., user empathy, collaboratively working with diversity, orientation toward learning, and creative confidence) were not significantly different.

The teaching contents used in the study were designed based on the project-based learning (PBL) strategy and the cognitive–affective interaction model (CAIM). The students’ learning outcomes were tested through a hands-on activity with the theme of electric boat creation. PBL with the CAIM was the strategy used to implement the hands-on STEAM activity and to achieve the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4). In this study, a quasi-experimental design was used for 10 weeks, and the 366 students who participated in the experiment were divided into experimental groups (EGs, 199 students using PBL with the CAIM) and control groups (CGs, 167 students using PBL only). Through the analysis of covariance, the results showed that students in the EGs achieved higher academic performance in terms of STEAM knowledge, creativity, and hands-on performance. The study also found that the hands-on STEAM activity had a positive effect on creativity for students in the EGs, allowing them to develop different modes of thinking in the processes of designing and producing the finished product, which in turn enhanced the innovativeness of their products and solutions. In addition, using PBL with the CAIM in the handson STEAM activity brought about positive learning outcomes and creative abilities for the students, achieving the SDG 4 objectives. Moreover, the outcomes of this study are in line with the current international trend in the development of education, providing reference examples for the future development of STEAM activities and teaching materials at the junior high school level. © 2022 by the authors.

"Bioinspiration as a method of problem-based STEM education: A case study with a class structured around the COVID-19 crisis","Snell-Rood E.C.; Smirnoff D.; Cantrell H.; Chapman K.; Kirscht E.; Stretch E.","2021","Ecology and Evolution","8","Article","EN","Bioinspiration is a promising lens for biology instruction as it allows the instructor to focus on current issues, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. From social distancing to oxygen stress, organisms have been tackling pandemic-related problems for millions of years. What can we learn from such diverse adaptations in our own applications? This review uses a seminar course on the COVID-19 crisis to illustrate bioinspiration as an approach to teaching biology content. At the start of the class, students mind-mapped the entire problem; this range of subproblems was used to structure the biology content throughout the entire class. Students came to individual classes with a brainstormed list of biological systems that could serve as inspiration for a particular problem (e.g., absorptive leaves in response to the problem of toilet paper shortages). After exploration of relevant biology content, discussion returned to the focal problem. Students dug deeper into the literature in a group project on mask design and biological systems relevant to filtration and transparency. This class structure was an engaging way for students to learn principles from ecology, evolution, behavior, and physiology. Challenges with this course design revolved around the interdisciplinary and creative nature of the structure; for instance, the knowledge of the participants was often stretched by engineering details. While the present class was focused on the COVID-19 crisis, a course structured through a bioinspired approach can be applied to other focal problems, or subject areas, giving instructors a powerful method to deliver interdisciplinary content in an integrated and inquiry-driven way. © 2021 The Authors.

"STEAM Maker Education: Conceal/Reveal of Personal, Artistic and Computational Dimensions in High School Student Projects","Lindberg L.; Fields D.A.; Kafai Y.B.","2020","Frontiers in Education","16","Article","EN","Much of maker education’s expansion has focused on STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) learning, leaving out equally promising opportunities for integrating arts learning. In this paper we share findings from a project in which high school students created electronic-textiles-based art representing features of a community important to them as a part of an elective high school computer science class. We addressed the following research questions: (1) What kinds of personal and community meanings did students convey through their maker projects? (2) How did students engage with artistic dimensions in their projects? (3) How did coding interactive features support students’ artwork? Drawing on daily observations, pre/post interviews, and documentation of students’ artifacts (photographs of in-process designs, design notebooks, and artist statements), we developed four case studies of students as they made art representing their communities using electronic-textiles as their primary medium. Our findings reveal how making became a means of personal, artistic expression with quite literal layering of coded meanings, and how maker activities can integrate art. In the discussion we consider the opportunities for authentic artistic expression in maker education by distinguishing the difference between craft and art in a maker education context. We consider the ways in which these ideas have implications for equity, pedagogy, and future research. © Copyright © 2020 Lindberg, Fields and Kafai."

Makerspace aims at creating a cohesive environment where participants learn while being creative. Additionally, it accomplishes twentyfirst century and entrepreneurial mindset learning objectives such as critical thinking, communication, collaboration, curiosity and creating value. Undergraduate STEM education is the most relevant field where makerspace can enhance learning process. However, makerspace is considered as a high investment project which can limit its implementation to a very small population of undergraduate students. With proper planning and creativity, educators can expose their students to makerspace without inflating the budget. In this study, a pop-up makerspace module was created for an undergraduate engineering course with a limited budget of 100. The students worked in groups to design, fabricate and verify the product functionality for a tissue engineering application. The module consisted of multiple stages which included brainstorming session, searching the market, design under constraints, select a design using a selection matrix, 3D print and verify the functionality of the product. The results obtained from student survey showed statistically significant improvement in technical, entrepreneurial mindset and 21st century skills. The open responses indicated students were engaged throughout the module and worked as a group to create a successful product.

Game-based learning (GBL) applications have been shown to successfully incite motivation in students and increase learning efficiency in both formal and non-formal educational settings. With the rise of GBL, researchers have also used virtual reality to provide pupils with a more immersive learning experience. Both GBL and virtual reality techniques are also used for computer programming education. However, there is a paucity of applications that utilize these techniques to incite interest in computer science from a female perspective. This is a cause for concern as immersive games have been proven to be capable of inciting affective motivation and fostering positive attitudes towards specific subjects. Hence, this review summarises the benefits and limitations of GBL and virtual reality; how males and females respond to certain game elements; and suggestions to aid in the development of immersive games to increase female participation in the field of computer science. © 2021.

"Analysis on trends of technology education shown in national curriculum at the elementary level in Republic of Korea","Go I.","2021","International Journal of Technology and Design Education","3","Article","EN","This study discusses the past and present of technology education in elementary schools of the Republic of Korea through an understanding of practical arts, one of the subjects taught in Korean elementary schools. Since technology education is carried out in Korean elementary schools through a subject called practical arts, it can be said that understanding the academic system and education curriculum of practical arts equates to understanding technology education being taught in elementary schools in Korea. There are three main contents of this study. First, the position of technology education in Korean elementary schools, the meaning of technology education activities, and the teaching system were examined by way of reviewing the practical arts in Korea. Second, the period, education thought, and key concepts of Korea’s technology education were analyzed by section as the researcher examined the development process of technology education in the practical arts curriculum. Third, the researcher comparatively analyzed the current 2015 Practical Arts Curriculum in Korea and technology education issues at the international level, and based on this, the researcher discussed the subject of developing technology education. The study found that in Korea, the practical arts curriculum underwent revision and development according to education thought over six time periods: subject-based curriculum in the first period from 1955 to 1962; experience-based curriculum in the second period from 1963 to 1972; discipline-based curriculum in the third period from 1973 to 1981; general education curriculum in the fourth period from 1982 to 1991; theme-based integrated curriculum in the fifth period from 1992 to 1996; and learning-based curriculum in the sixth period from 1997 to 2014. The most recent revision from 2015 represents competency-based education thought in the curriculum. The competencies related to technology education that are presented in the 2015 revision include technology problem-solving ability, technology system planning ability, and technology application ability. With these, the curriculum focuses on enhancing the ability to apply skills and generate new knowledge in the context of living, which can be interpreted as a new value for technology education to pursue in the age of competency-based education: “practicing knowledge rather than simply knowing.” In addition, based on the new curriculum content framework, technological literacy was reconceptualized as “what students should know” and “what students should be able to do”, suggesting a new approach to technological literacy in the competency-based education age. Additionally, in such an age, the curriculum’s responsibilities and ethics are presented as issues that should be considered anew, making it clearer what the next tasks should be in order to better improve the curriculum. The results of this study will be meaningful in providing insight into the current direction of elementary-level technology education in Korea and also into the future direction of technology education in Korea and around the world in today’s age of competency-based education by analyzing and comparing Korea’s case with international cases. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V."
"Integrated STEAM Approach in Outdoor Trails with Elementary School Pre-service Teachers","Haas B.; Kreis Y.; Lavicza Z.","2021","Educational Technology and Society","17","Article","EN","Due to the COVID-19 pandemic it was impossible to carry out on-campus teaching and examinations as planned for the first-year elementary school Bachelor’s degree teacher training courses during the summer term of 2019/2020. Therefore, we moved our on-campus STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) related courses to schooling at home. For their course examination, students designed outdoor trails in groups with the educational technology MathCityMap based on an integrated STEAM approach. Hence, they combined STEAM with real-world situations (e.g., monuments, marketplaces, playgrounds). The tasks within the trails required the use of technologies such as augmented reality (AR), digital modelling (e.g., GeoGebra 3D Graphing Calculator), and GPS. Analogue measuring tools (e.g., triangle ruler) were also used in the task designs. We collected data from 21 trails with 259 tasks from 49 pre-service teachers to analyse the effects on professional growth in STEAM education. Through hierarchical cluster analysis we identified three different clusters with patterns regarding STEAM in outdoor trails. This paper will describe a pedagogical framework for the integrated STEAM approach to designing and evaluating outdoor trails. Furthermore, we will explain patterns pre-service teachers developed during this professional development. © 2021"

Sample: The study sample comprised 74 7th-grade students from two different classes in a Turkish secondary school (study group and control group). Design and Methods: An experimental embedded mixed methods design was used, primarily based on quantitative data, with the qualitative data set embedded within and generally playing a supportive role. A control group was used to determine the role of the STEAM approach in the students’ conceptual understanding. A STEAM approach was administered to the study group, while the control group was taught according to the regular science curriculum. Research data were collected with the Force and Energy Conceptual Test and through semi-structured interviews with ten study group students. Results: The results demonstrate that STEAM education positively affected the students’ conceptual understanding and reduced or shifted the number of misconceptions. Furthermore, the study group’s post-trial conceptual understanding scores were significantly higher than those of the control group. The interviewees indicated that STEAM education’s support for a learner-centered environment fostered the students’ conceptual understandings. Conclusions: STEAM education is useful for understanding concepts. This study contributes to the literature by investigating the effect of STEAM education approaches on students’ conceptual understanding. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

"Design and Analysis of a Virtual Reality Game to Address Issues in Introductory Programming Learning","Wee C.; Yap K.M.","2021","Lecture Notes of the Institute for Computer Sciences, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering, LNICST","3","Conference paper","EN","The field of computer science has not shied away from employing game-based learning and virtual reality techniques for computer programming education. While a plethora of game-based, virtual reality or combinations of both solutions exist, most are developed as an alternative to traditional lessons where students focus on learning programming concepts or languages. However, these solutions do not cater to problems students face when learning programming that is mainly caused by the abstract nature of programming, misconceptions of programming concepts and lack of learning motivation. Hence, in this paper, a framework to address the abstract nature of programming, common programming misconceptions and motivational issues is developed. The framework consists of three modules that correspond to each issue powered by a simulation engine. To address the abstract nature of programming, programming concepts will be represented with concrete objects in the virtual environment. Furthermore, to address common programming misconceptions, simulation techniques such as interactions and player perspective will be utilised. Lastly, motivational game elements will be employed into the simulation to engage students when learning through the system. Results gathered from questionnaires indicated that users were generally satisfied with the virtual experience developed from the framework. © 2021, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering."

"Educational Makerspaces and Conceptual Art Projects Supporting STEAM Education","Olabe J.C.; Basogain X.; Olabe M.A.","2020","ACM International Conference Proceeding Series","1","Conference paper","EN","The integration of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) in K-12 education has been a priority for most countries around the world for the last decade. However, the intrinsic difficulty of mathematics and the sciences has limited the success of this integration. Educational Makerspaces have recently been identified as ideal environments for the successful integration of STEAM in the classroom. Educational Makerspaces promote learning as a group activity. This learning involves constructionism: designing and building artifacts. In addition, the inspiration and emotional support derived from working in a group provides the motivation to overcome the traditional obstacles found in STEAM projects. In this paper we present two workshops that are part of a research project to integrate STEAM and Educational Makerspaces in the university environment. The curriculum of the workshops is defined by the implementation of STEAM ideas derived from museum-quality Conceptual artworks. The design of these workshops is intended to be integrated in high schools and the education activities of art museums and libraries.

"Creative Anticipatory Ethical Reasoning with Scenario Analysis and Design Fiction","York E.; Conley S.N.","2020","Science and Engineering Ethics","18","Article","EN","This paper presents an experimental approach for engaging undergraduate STEM students in anticipatory ethical reasoning, or ethical reasoning applied to the analysis of potential mid- to long-term implications and outcomes of technological innovation. The authors implemented two variations of an approach that integrates three key components—scenario analysis, design fiction, and ethical frameworks—into five sections of an introductory course on the social contexts of science and technology that is required of STEM majors. The authors dub this approach Creative Anticipatory Ethical Reasoning, or CAER. Scenario analysis is a strategy emerging from business consulting for grounded analysis of plausible future trajectories to inform planning. Design fiction is a creative hands-on activity that blends science fiction and design prototyping to facilitate critical thinking with respect to the societal dimensions of a plausible future technology. The authors present the following findings: in each of the variations, students demonstrated significant engagement with CAER and a substantive shift in their conception of what constitutes responsible innovation and ethical conduct in science and technology. Specifically, their integration of ethical reasoning with stakeholder perspectives and scenario analysis reframed technologies, from unproblematic solutions for societal problems to socially-embedded forms of life that might diverge from designers’ intentions. This suggests that CAER could be a useful pedagogical intervention for expanding students’ ethical engagement to consider the potential unintended consequences of technological innovation. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V."

The study examines the quality of the reflections from primary school students during group processing when participating in Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (STEAM) instructional approaches. The project’s core methodology lies in scientific (physics) and artistic (dance) instructional activities which were executed in a continuous reflective and cooperative learning environment. The educational approach was refined by analyzing the reflective discussions from focus groups where descriptive, argumentative, reflective and critical reflective knowledge about acquired knowledge, competences, beliefs, attitudes and emotions were considered. While the educational intervention proved that 1st-year (K-7) students essentially reflected at the level of description, 3rd-year (K-9) and 5th-year (K-11) students, however, attained higher levels of individual critical reflection development than initially anticipated. The STEAM approaches were found to produce significant use and understanding of both science and artistic concepts and to increase a sense of competence readiness and a perception of modes of cooperation such as individual responsibility and promotive interaction. © 2020 by the authors.

However, this novel concept has not been clearly conceptualized; this is likely attributed to the lack of a grounding theory to frame STEAM. We propose using connected learning theory to examine a previously developed STEAM conceptual model. This work explores the potential of connected learning theory to understand specific STEAM instructional practices. Using observations of 43 middle-grade teachers from 14 schools enacting STEAM practices in their classrooms, we examined what connected learning looked like in STEAM classrooms and how the STEAM conceptual model could be enhanced by analyzing implementation practices through the principles of connected learning. The qualitative data analysis of observations, video recorded data, and debriefing sessions with teachers after the observations included two rounds of analysis. This found significant overlap in ideas of connected learning and STEAM, notably a shared emphasis on design, collaboration, and contextualized learning. © 2019, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan."
"Exploring the Explicit Teaching Strategies in STEAM Program of Climate Change","Park Y.S.; Park J.H.","2020","Asia-Pacific Science Education","3","Article","EN","The study introduces exemplary explicit teaching strategies as enacted by a middle school STEAM teacher. Through a 10-lesson climate change STEAM program, data were collected to explore explicit teaching strategies using O-TOP (Oregon Collaborative for Excellence in the Preparation [OCEPT] Teaching Observation Protocol) and NGSS 8 Practices (Next Generation Science Standards). Data from teacher interviews and class observations were also used to identify and describe how this STEAM teacher offered students opportunities to solve real problems in their community. Examples demonstrating three stages of STEAM education: understanding context presentation, performing creative design, and experiencing emotional touch are provided. We argue STEAM programs should be presented with more realistic issues arising from the community students belong to and that explicit teaching strategies should give students the opportunity to achieve core competencies and scientific literacy. Our study offers implications about the need for systemic teacher training and professional development for STEAM education. © Park and Park, 2020"
"STEAM Education for Enhancing Creativity in Packaging Design","Sakon T.; Petsangsri S.","2021","Archives of Design Research","8","Article","EN","Background The creative development of packaging design, using the STEAM teaching method and combined with Guilford (1950)’s creative design, was synthesized into a teaching model named “CREATE.” Each stage of the model included learning management, following the STEAM Education ideas (Yakman & Lee, 2012) that integrated science, technology, engineering, mathematics and arts links in each step. The principles of Structural Packaging and Creating Packaging with this system enabled students to design packaging with an imaginative form, an exotic shape, which required bending and deforming at various angles. The integrated design technique, allowed designers to develop a large variety of shapes. For packaging, this developed the ability for design in the long-term. Methods The population consisted of 120 second-year students of the Industrial Craft Design Program at Thammasat University, Thailand. We used purposive selection to sample 30 subjects. In the experiment, we used these tools: 1) CREATE model for teaching in the subject of “Creative Packaging Design” 2) Lesson Plan 3) Test of Creative Thinking. Data was collected three times - before studying (Pretest: 1), after studying (Posttest: 2) and in a follow-up phase (Follow up: 3) - to study the effects of creativity with repeated measure ANOVA. Results The mean of the repeated measurements for the creative score of packaging design from the ANOVA multivariate test was significantly less than the target significance level (p<0.05). This showed that the independent variable (i.e., the practice score from using our STEAM method) affected the dependent variable (i.e., the score assigned for creativity in the student assignment) submitted in the Packaging Design course. The posttest (Posttest: 2) scores were significantly higher than the pretest scores (p<0.05) and the scores two weeks after graduation (Follow up: 3) were also higher than the pretest scores (p<0.05). Thus, retention of the key ideas taught in the course, was high. Furthermore, the posttest and follow up phase scores were not significantly different, thus confirming good retention. Conclusions We studied creativity in packaging design of students using our CREATE Model for teaching in computer graphic design courses. Each step of the teaching model applied STEAM Education for students to use the concepts in a scientific process, combined with the theory of packaging design. Key aspects of our approach were the exchange of ideas among students, the activities designed to encourage creativity and generally enjoying ‘thinking outside the box’. so that learners strengthened their ability to design creative packaging, could develop packaging designs in a variety of formats and retain learned concepts. © 2021.

"Technology in Space Education as a postgraduate program preparing teachers for the future","Weizman A.","2021","Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC","0","Conference paper","EN","This paper presents an initiative of a new program for postgraduate students, focusing on technology in space education. The program is part of M.Ed. studies in Educational Technology at the Kibbutzim College of Education in Israel. The goal of this program is to develop leaders in educational technology who can deal with the frequent developments in technology, are able to include space related projects in teaching, and can cope with situations of uncertainty and failure. The pedagogical approaches we use are based on the combination of computational thinking with creative learning and design thinking. Students engage in a design process in which they prepare their projects, study the influence on their students, and reflect on their own learning and teaching. The learning process involves many challenges and unexpected difficulties. The modeling process involves scaffolding, so that the first task is easier than the next one. Nevertheless, since dealing with frustration and failure is one of the main competencies needed in the 21st century, we see this experience as an important part of the studies. After two years, our experience shows that students realized that failure is a necessary step in any innovative design process and concluded that with the right mentoring they will be able to overcome any challenge.

"Gamified active learning and its potential for social change","Marin S.; Lee V.; Landers R.N.","2021","Transforming Society and Organizations through Gamification: From the Sustainable Development Goals to Inclusive Workplaces","3","Book chapter","EN","In this chapter, we describe active learning, explain how the use of game elements and active learning strategies are related, and discuss how gamification can be used to facilitate active learning and foster positive social change, which brings a wide range of positive social impacts. We conceptualize what active learning is based on existing theory and present evidence of its effectiveness. Next, we discuss the social impacts of active learning in education. Then, we draw connections between active learning techniques and gamification to arrive at gamified active learning, which forms the core of this chapter. We consider how gamified active learning might remedy some of the social issues in education disparities, particularly in STEM education, and hence elicit change at a societal level, thereby eliciting positive social change. We conclude that gamified active learning has potential to induce social change as an education intervention if researchers target student outcomes that have implications for social impact (e.g., student retention, on-time graduation). We recommend further research be conducted on the role of gameful design when implementing active learning strategies that target specific learning outcomes. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021."
"A Classification Scheme for Gamification in Computer Science Education: Discovery of Foundational Gamification Genres in Data Structures Courses","Spanier A.; Harms S.W.; Hastings J.","2021","Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE","5","Conference paper","EN","This research full paper presents two main outcomes: 1) a novel classification system for gamification implementations including proposed genres, and 2) a comprehensive study and categorization of existing DSA gamification applications and a discussion of genres absent existing applications. Gamification presents a great potential to improve user engagement, motivation, and learning in nearly all fields of study including computer science (CS) education. However, it lacks formalized study and comprehensive analysis in CS education, and thus what makes for effective gamification is still a key question. Rather than initially trying to examine and catalog existing gamification applications and studies across the breadth of CS education as a whole, this paper instead focuses on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) courses. In general, DSA courses tend to be difficult due to the inherent complexity and abstraction exhibited by the fundamental concepts. As such, gamification presents a potential opportunity to convey these complex ideas in meaningful and unique ways. To carry out this work, a literature review of current DSA gamification applications is presented, the applications are categorized, and the pros and cons analyzed. Based on this analysis, a classification system is created and two new abstract genres are identified: dynamic gamification and collaborative gamification development. Potential uses, benefits and detriments are suggested for these newly identified genres. With this analysis and classification of gamification along with the identification of new abstract genres, the practice of gamification in DSA coursework can be made more efficient and effective. Upon a more thorough understanding of DSA gamification, pedagogical considerations can be made to better aid teachers and instructors in the integration of gamification into existing curriculum. The paper also touches on the applicability of the classification system to CS gamification examples outside of DSA.  © 2021 IEEE."

This outreach consortium is financed by the Department of Energy DOE, as well as the NNSA (National Nuclear Security Administration). With this summer program, our objective is to serve advanced manufacturing, as evolving technology and to improve STEM education and prepare future engineers for the new challenges related to this new technology. The main objective is to teach the students the use of professional design tools made for today's designers and engineers, such as Autodesk Inventor, as well as the use of 3D printers. In addition, science, and math are integrated to show relationships and solve challenges related to several projects. The progressive level of the projects related to producing better parts, assemblies, and drawings mostly focuses on critical thinking and the development of creative solutions (problem-solving, writing, visual art, communication skills, and open-mindedness) to problems. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the consortium management and the use of the summer program as example to describe the methodology implemented, based on active learning, perform experimentation, and the use of software, such as Autodesk Inventor. In particular, we will discuss several activities performed during this summer camp. A collaborative work between an NCAT faculty and high school instructors have been developed over the years served for the success of this program. The high-school instructors, as well as the counselors, helped with the process, as well as with the learning process. Their participation was very useful in terms of addressing the appropriate pedagogy, communicating with high-school students, and keeping them focused and task.

"Immersion positively affects learning in virtual reality games compared to equally interactive 2d games","Thompson M.; Uz-Bilgin C.; Tutwiler M.S.; Anteneh M.; Meija J.C.; Wang A.; Tan P.; Eberhardt R.; Roy D.; Perry J.; Klopfer E.","2021","Information and Learning Science","15","Article","EN","Purpose: This study isolates the effect of immersion on players’ learning in a virtual reality (VR)-based game about cellular biology by comparing two versions of the game with the same level of interactivityand different levels of immersion. The authors identify immersion and additional interactivity as two key affordances of VR as a learning tool. A number of research studies compare VR with two-dimensional or minimally interactive media; this study focuses on the effect of immersion as a result of the head mounted display (HMD). Design/methodology/approach: In the game, players diagnose a cell by exploring a virtual cell and search for clues that indicate one of five possible types of cystic fibrosis. Fifty-one adults completed all aspects of the study. Players took pre and post assessments and drew pictures of cells and translation before and after the game. Players were randomly assigned to play the game with the HMD (stereoscopic view) or without the headset (non-stereoscopic view). Players were interviewed about their drawings and experiences at the end of the session. Findings: Players in both groups improved in their knowledge of the cell environment and the process of translation. Players who experienced the immersive stereoscopic view had a more positive learning effect in the content assessment, and stronger improvement in their mental models of the process of translation between pre- and post-drawings compared to players who played the two-dimensional game. Originality/value: This study suggests that immersion alone has a positive effect on conceptual understanding, especially in helping learners understand spatial environments and processes. These findings set the stage for a new wave of research on learning in immersive environments; research that moves beyond determining whether immersive media correlate with more learning, toward a focus on the types of learning outcomes that are best supported by immersive media. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."

The formal education system in Egypt is heavily focused on rote learning, where concepts are introduced in isolation and detached from their real-world contexts. A design-based approach is proposed as an alternative, where fabrication labs serve as stimulating environments that could potentially support concept learning in STEM. However, more needs to be known about how learning STEM concepts can be scaffolded in a design-based learning experience in a fabrication lab. This paper demonstrates the initial outcomes of a research in progress that aims to generate principles for designing learning experiences that scaffold STEM concepts for young learners in fabrication labs.

However, implementing STEAM in the classroom can be challenging for educators, as it may require collaboration across disciplines, increased workload, and understanding the nature of STEAM integration. This paper details a mixed-methods evaluation of a year-long STEAM teacher training program, in which a STEM teacher and an arts teacher collaborated to design and implement integrated STEAM lessons at each of the nine participating schools (n = 17). The training program consisted of a 5-week summer professional development experience, followed by ongoing financial, material, and pedagogical support during the school year, made possible by the partnership of the schools, a university, and community organizations. Findings from surveys, focus groups, and written reflections suggest that, despite certain challenges, aspects of the training program supported teacher implementation of STEAM. Participation in the program impacted teachers’ collaboration, pedagogy, self-efficacy, and arts integration practices. The findings offer insight into the forms of support that teachers deem important in STEAM teacher training programs and the benefits of such a program for teachers’ professional development. © 2021 by the authors.

"Effects of Competitive Coding Games on Novice Programmers","Fischer K.; Vaupel S.; Heller N.; Mader S.; Bry F.","2021","Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing","1","Conference paper","EN","Coding platforms provide challenges for users to solve in order to improve their programming skills, utilizing elements of both Technology Enhanced Learning and gamification. Inspired by previous approaches, this article presents a coding platform focused on competition, and its evaluation in the context of tertiary programming education. The system provides programming challenges for two users to compete against each other in real time. We seek to answer the question whether this notion of one-on-one competition can increase motivation to solve programming tasks. Two user studies were conducted in order to evaluate the effects of the system’s competitive component on users’ self-assessment, enjoyment, and motivation. The results of these studies suggest that this kind of competitive environment in programming leads to learners assessing themselves more distinctively, while their enjoyment decreases. Furthermore, learners’ motivation drops in competition with others, although it remains on a high level. Learners who already achieved a relatively high level of programming knowledge are generally more inclined to enjoy competitive game components in programming. We conclude that competition in programming education does not necessarily have solely positive effects on learners’ experiences. The inclusion of competition in tertiary computer science education might prove to be useful, but further research needs to be conducted to identify the best way of integrating it into educational concepts. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

To ensure sufficiently high and qualified enrolment in higher STEM education, we need to bridge this gap between secondary and higher STEM education by showing our youngsters the relevance of science and technology to their personal life and environment. To this end, the project STEM@school promoted and studied the idea of integrated STEM in secondary education in Flanders, Belgium. In integrated STEM education, learning contents from the separate STEM courses are linked in an authentic way, as they often are in our environmental challenges. This approach encourages students as well as their teachers to acquire a robust understanding of STEM concepts, and a creative, inquisitive, and collaborative mindset. For the design of integrated STEM curricula, STEM@school united secondary-school STEM teachers and university researchers. This article elaborates on the principles, opportunities and challenges of the design and implementation of these curricula and discusses their promising effects on students' conceptual understanding and attitudes towards STEM subjects.

Through a mixed-methods study of teachers’ and students’ experiences of group work, this article compares two disciplines that maintain distinct discourses on teaching collaboration: Software design and choreography. The quantitative data reveals that despite significant demographic differences, students from the two disciplines maintain a common enthusiasm for group learning. There are significant distinctions however, on student perceptions of the teaching and learning of collaboration, their learning achievements about group work, and the relevance of group work in their discipline. Qualitative commentaries from students and teachers extend the arguments across both the distinctions and the similarities, emphasizing the impact of particular teaching practices and establishing standpoints for further research into the pedagogy of collaboration in higher education. © 2020 The authors and IJLTER.ORG.

This would require them to have a design thinking mindset (DTM) as a basic requirement. However, it has been argued that it is difficult to measure DTM using a questionnaire. Therefore, there has been little information if Thai elementary teachers possess DTM. This study aimed to develop and validate a Thai version of DTM questionnaire with two groups of Thai elementary teachers (N=138). Successively determinding Cronbach's alpha values with each group of the teachers, six components of DTM were suggested. These components included (1) Being comfortable with problems, (2) User empathy, (3) Mindfulness of the process, (4) Collaborative working with diversity, (5) Orientation to learning, and (6) Creative confidence. While this result may need to be comfirmed with a larger population of teachers, a Thai version of the questionnaire can be potentially used to explore Thai elementary teachers' DTM in other contexts.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."

A total of 971 articles published in peer-reviewed journals and conferences were collected from Web of Science and Scopus databases to conduct the bibliometric analysis. Furthermore, content analysis was conducted on 39 articles that met the inclusion criteria. This study demonstrates that VR research for CS education was faring well around 2011 but witnessed low production output between the years 2013 and 2016. However, scholars have increased their contribution in this field recently, starting from the year 2017. This study also revealed prolific scholars contributing to the field. It provides insightful information regarding research hotspots in VR that have emerged recently, which can be further explored to enhance CS education. In addition, the quantitative method remains the most preferred research method, while the questionnaire was the most used data collection technique. Moreover, descriptive analysis was primarily used in studies on VR in CS education. The study concludes that even though scholars are leveraging VR to advance CS education, more effort needs to be made by stakeholders across countries and institutions. In addition, a more rigorous methodological approach needs to be employed in future studies to provide more evidence-based research output.

"Active learning augmented reality for steam education—a case study","Jesionkowska J.; Wild F.; Deval Y.","2020","Education Sciences","107","Article","EN","Immersive technologies are rapidly transforming the field of education. Amongst them, Augmented Reality (AR) has shown promise as a resource, particularly for education in Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM). There are, however, few teachers deploying this new medium in the classroom directly, and, consequently, only a few, elect students benefit from the AR-enriched offers. Curricula are already overloaded, and schools generally lack developmental resources, thus leaving no room for experimentation. This situation is further aggravated by the too few educational applications available with sufficient learning content. In this article, we investigate the method of Active Learning for the teaching of STEAM subjects, using a format where students are tasked with building an AR application as part of their learning. We evaluate the applicability of the Active Learning for STEAM subjects with a qualitative, case study approach, applying the workshop format as an extracurricular activity in our work with students from a range of secondary schools in Oxford. We discuss how the format works, so it can be embedded into regular curricula, not just as an extracurricular activity, also providing an overview on the involved teaching units and rationale. All teams in our preview audience of the case study succeeded in building working applications, several of impressive complexity. Students found that the lessons were enjoyable and AR technology can enhance their learning experience. The Active Learning method served as a catalyst for students’ skills development, with the case study providing evidence of learning to code, working with a physics simulation engine, ray-tracing, and geometry, learning how to manage teams and interact with other students/instructors, and engineering a working prototype of a game. We consequentially argue that combining the STEM subjects and the arts, using the proposed Active Learning format, is able to provide a more holistic and engaging education. © 2020 by the authors.

"A study on the impact of steam education for sustainable development courses and its effects on student motivation and learning","Hsiao P.-W.; Su C.-H.","2021","Sustainability (Switzerland)","62","Article","EN","In 2019, the United Nations released its 10-year policy of ""ESD for 2030"". Many schools around the world have actively participated in the transformation and have included the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). Many developed countries hope to combine the concept of STEAM education (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics) with interdisciplinary learning, and apply it to ESD. This study intended to integrate the sustainability concept into Virtual Reality (VR) system-aided STEAM ed­ucation, in order to provide school children with integrated interdisciplinary STEAM education. A literature review was conducted and the research hypotheses were proposed. The empirical method and questionnaires were used as research methods to investigate the influence of the proposed sys­tem on the students' satisfaction, self-efficacy, and learning outcomes after cognition learning. The results of this study showed that the combination of STEAM education, with VR-aided experience courses, could help to improve the learning satisfaction and outcomes of students and to arouse their learning motivation. However, the proposed system needs an ESD that is based on students' traditional culture (such as designing a role-playing game), so that they can improve their self-effi­cacy through playing a VR game. Although VR games are interesting, they are difficult for some students to play. Therefore, it is necessary to adjust the teaching materials, methods, and strategies appropriately by using information technology, so that ESD can be achieved by inspiring students to explore continuously.

"A NOVEL TRILOGY OF E-STEM PROGRAMS","Gharib M.; Katbeh T.; Benjamin Cieslinski G.; Creel B.","2021","ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition, Proceedings (IMECE)","3","Conference paper","EN","In recent years, pre-college educational programs have been introduced to increase the interest and supply of skillful people to work in STEM fields. While the emphasis has previously been primarily focused on the content of project-based learning programs, another factor that needs to be accounted for is the accessibility of the said programs. Unprecedented issues such as the sudden closure of educational facilities, as was experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, should not hinder the learning opportunities that the students are after. Therefore, the shift from hosting conventional STEM programs to online platforms has become a crucial element in the expansion of STEM education. Delivering engineering-based projects through online STEM programs to school students includes wide expansion of the participating audience – which is not confined by the capacity limit of in-person programs – as well as ease of access. This has value not only on the individual level but also at the social level. Three successful e-STEM (electronic STEM) programs are presented in this paper that are designed to support and enhance students’ learning of engineering concepts while also increasing students’ understanding of real-life applications. This has a close connection to the desire to increase online education in developing countries over recent years. The first program is called Innovate, Design and Engineer an App (IDEA). In this program, the students explore the fundamentals of programming and mobile app development. This provides the students with the foundation of coding, algorithms, and refining their ideas to produce a working mobile phone app that is created to meet a specified challenge. The second program is called Creative Fusion and Innovation (CFI). In this program, the students learned the basics of creating, editing, and analyzing their 3D designs; recognize the importance of creating 3D models in engineering; and understand how 3D printing works as they create their own 3D models. The third program is called Virtual Robotics Games (VRG). In this program, the students learn the fundamentals of designing, building, programming, and testing robots in a virtual environment. Through this program, the students learn the basics of robot design in addition to coding and simulation, which are all necessary tools for aspiring engineers. These programs aim to provide STEM education access to build communities specifically in engineering, which is in high demand. Throughout these programs, the students are able to learn important computer skills and the concepts of the engineering design process. The programs also equip them with the required knowledge and problem-solving skills to tackle challenges. At the end of each program, the students will have created successful designs as solutions to the real-life problems that they were tasked with. In this paper, the details behind the planning, formation and production, and implementation of the three online programs are presented. Copyright © 2021 by ASME"

"Automated Assessment of Android Exercises with Cloud-native Technologies","Bruzual D.; Montoya Freire M.L.; Di Francesco M.","2020","Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education, ITiCSE","8","Conference paper","EN","Mobile applications are very challenging to test as they usually have a complex graphical user interface and advanced functionality that involves interacting with remote services. Due to these features, student assessment in courses about mobile application development usually relies on assignments or projects that are manually checked by teaching assistants for grading. This approach clearly does not scale to large classrooms, especially for online courses. This article presents a novel system for automated assessment of Android exercises with cloud-native technologies. Different from the state of the art, the proposed solution leverages a mobile app testing framework that is largely used in the industry instead of custom libraries. Furthermore, the devised system employs software containers and scales with the availability of resources in a data center, which is essential for massive open online courses. The system design and implementation is detailed, together with the results from a deployment within a master-level course with 120 students. The received feedback demonstrates that the proposed solution was effective, as it provided insightful feedback and supported independent learning of mobile application development. © 2020 ACM."

"Promoting Computer Science Learning with Block-Based Programming and Narrative-Centered Gameplay","Min W.; Mott B.; Park K.; Taylor S.; Akram B.; Wiebe E.; Boyer K.E.; Lester J.","2020","IEEE Conference on Computatonal Intelligence and Games, CIG","12","Conference paper","EN","Recent years have seen increasing awareness of the need for all students in primary and secondary education to learn computer science (CS) concepts and skills. Educational games hold significant potential to serve as a platform for CS education because they integrate engaging problem solving with effective pedagogical strategies. This potential is especially high for narrative-centered educational games that embed learning activities within rich interactive stories. In this paper, we present an educational game featuring block-based programming challenges contextualized within an engaging narrative, designed to promote CS learning for middle school students (ages 11 to 13). In the game, students undertake problem-solving challenges that are aligned with the K-12 Computer Science Framework. Results from a classroom implementation of the game with middle grade students suggest that their perceived game control ratings are positively correlated with their progress in the game, which suggests the need for adaptively supporting students' game-based learning activities. Building on these findings, we discuss design implications for creating student-adaptive CS learning experiences in educational games that incorporate block-based programming enriched narrative-centered gameplay.  © 2020 IEEE."

It serves both as a source of hard computational problems and as precise language allowing for the formalization of sound security models. While dealing with the mathematical foundations of cybersecurity is only possible in specialized courses (tertiary level and beyond), it is essential to promote the role of mathematics in this field at early educational stages. With this in mind, we introduce Crypto Go, a physical card game that may be used both as a dissemination and as an educational tool. The game is carefully devised in order to entertain and stimulate players, while boosting their understanding on how basic cryptographic tools work and interplay. To get a preliminary assessment of our design, we collected data from a series of test workshops, which engaged over two hundred players from different ages and educational backgrounds. This basic evaluation indeed confirms that Crypto Go significantly improves students’ motivation and has a positive impact in their perception and understanding of the field. ©2020 by the authors.

"STEM projects as science teaching and learning strategies in teacher training and primary education: Cognitive and affective analysis","Borreguero G.M.; Núñez M.M.; Correa F.L.N.","2021","Topics in Science Education","1","Book chapter","EN","Integrated STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education has been recognized as a useful educational paradigm for developing valuable personal and professional skills and competencies. These include research, problem solving, critical and creative thinking, collaboration, teamwork, and communication. Likewise, several studies highlight the potential of STEM education to foster students' attitudes and interests in the study of these subjects. It seems advisable, therefore, to apply these educational practices from the early school years. It is at this stage that the first attitudes and emotions towards STEM areas begin to be forged, since the cognitive domain is linked to the affective domain and vice versa. The main objective of this study was to design and implement playful science projects in the elementary classroom that facilitate the learning of STEM concepts in formal contexts and promote positive emotions in students. The research design was quasi-experimental, with experimental groups, pre-test, posttest, and mixed analysis of the cognitive and affective variables under study. The sample consisted of 664 participants, of whom 190 were primary school teachers in training and 474 were primary school students (10-12 years old). As a measuring instrument, several questionnaires were designed and validated to assess the variables referred to the cognitive and affective domain before and after the didactic interventions carried out in the classroom. STEM projects on different curricular contents were designed and implemented. The results obtained show the didactic effectiveness of the projects developed in the improvement of the conceptual domain in science, finding statistically significant differences (Sig. < 0.05) between the pre-test and the post-test in both study samples. Positive results were also obtained in the affective and emotional variables analysed. An increase in the interest of the surveyed participants in learning scientific-technological contents in a practical way was also observed. Based on these results, it is considered that integrated STEM education may have a significant effect on student learning and on the teacher training of the future educator. It is also assumed that science teaching at the primary stage can be supported by teachers who have received initial training in science based on STEM integration. © 2021 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

"Digital Learning Games for Mathematics and Computer Science Education: The Need for Preregistered RCTs, Standardized Methodology, and Advanced Technology","Bertram L.","2020","Frontiers in Psychology","19","Article","EN","In today’s digital information society, mathematical and computational skills are becoming increasingly important. With the demand for mathematical and computational literacy rising, the question of how these skills can be effectively taught in schools is among the top priorities in education. Game-based learning promises to diversify education, increase students’ interest and motivation, and offer positive and effective learning experiences. Especially digital game-based learning (DGBL) is considered an effective educational tool for improving education in classrooms of the future. Yet, learning is a complex psychological phenomenon and the effectiveness of digital games for learning cannot be taken for granted. This is partly due to a diversity of methodological approaches in the literature and partly due to theoretical and practical considerations. We present core elements of psychological theories of learning and derive arguments for and against DGBL and non-DGBL. We discuss previous literature on DGBL in mathematics education from a methodological point of view and infer the need for randomized controlled trials for effectiveness evaluations. To increase comparability of empirical results, we propose methodological standards for future educational research. The value of multidisciplinary research projects to advance the field of DGBL is discussed and a synergy of Affective Computing and Optimal Experimental Design (OED) techniques is proposed for the implementation of adaptive technologies in digital learning games. Finally, we make suggestions for game content, which would be suitable for preparing students for university-level mathematics and computer science education, and discuss the potential limitations of DGBL in the classroom. © Copyright © 2020 Bertram."

The author elucidates a comparative analytical review of trends and prospects for the development of STEAM education in the RU Federation. In this paper, the authors want to touch upon a comprehensive theoretical and methodological study conducted on the declared problem to identify the problem of the formation and development of the STEAM approach in the education system in the RU Federation at all levels: general education, vocational education, and additional education. The object of this study was STEM education. The subject of this research was the STEM approach and STEM technologies in the system of general education, vocational education, and additional education. The methodological foundation of the study was the general scientific propositions on the holistic, systemic, and dialectical approaches to research, which made it possible to assess the totality of interrelated and interacting elements that form a certain integrity. The use of these approaches provided a comprehensive analysis and formulation of the research problem and determined the strategy for its study. The analysis of the current state of STEM and STEAM education in higher education in the RU Federation suggests that it is necessary to stimulate the development of information and communication technologies in the country's education system in general, as well as to develop comprehensive programs for adapting STEM and STEAM approaches among the subjects of educational relations. In the context of modern global risks and challenges, the educational trajectory of development in Russia should be conceptually consistent with the new strategy in the field of natural science education adopted in the United States, “The Path to Success: American Strategy for STEM Education”. Experts believe that through the practical implementation of STEM and STEAM technologies, it is possible to improve the efficiency of the quality of training for the purposes of the modern digital economic sphere. In this regard, the primary competences obtained in the higher education system in the areas of STEM and STEAM training should be cognitive, personal, and interpersonal competences, expressed in digital literacy, computational thinking, creativity, open mind, soft skills, and others. The concept of STEAM education in the system of higher professional education in Russia will ensure the transformation of ideas about scientific knowledge and build an innovative development process through the formation of skills in the field of exact sciences, linguistics, engineering, art, etc. © 2021 the authors; licensee Modestum.

Although this trend is currently limited to middle school, high school, and higher education, prior research suggests that children 5 years and older, may yield long-term gains from exploring developmentally-appropriate concepts from novel STEM fields. Although there is little research on educational technologies or resources to support young children's curiosity and learning in this novel domain, some research suggests that young children may already be forming preconceptions about genetics and biology (e.g., from popular media). Tangible technologies, which provide children qualitatively new, developmentally appropriate ways to engage with ideas and techniques, have been shown to support children's engagement with foundational ideas relevant to biodesign, including the engineering design process. By applying developmentally appropriate constraints to our technology development (e.g., through frameworks such as the Positive Technological Development), the research team developed and evaluated a novel tangible technology called CRISPEE to introduce young children to concepts of biology and engineering. This article describes an experimental pilot study to investigate (1) how young children interact with the CRISPEE technological prototype, and (2) what prior knowledge the average child might bring to an educational biodesign activity.

This work consists of a qualitative descriptive experience sampling that arises from retrospective documental sources of the process and personal impressions of the authors. Five hundred (n=500) senior high school students and 14 tutoring teachers from a private school in Brazil participated, the theme projects were based on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) established by the United Nations Organization. The students were able to study and discuss some SDGs goals, choose one and develop a project so as to experience the phases of DT (Empathy, Definition, Idealization, Prototyping). At the end of the course, the students were capable of developing and delivering a prototype (digital or physical) and presenting their work. This report showed that DT can be a good strategy for implementing the Project-Based Learning with STEAM approach helping students to integrate inter, trans and multidisciplinary content and develop competences and skills such as: teamwork/collaborative actions; argumentation/negotiation/communication skills; reflective thinking and logical reasoning; creativity; time management in a project; resilience and tolerance when the group had to face some frustrations (projects that did not go as expected, lack of material/time/planning or disagreement between teammates), as well as development of the ability to use different resources to create their prototypes (like scrap materials, metal tools, or some technological resources to create digital prototypes).

"Promoting a mixed-design model of scientific creativity through digital storytelling—the CCQ model for creativity","Smyrnaiou Z.; Georgakopoulou E.; Sotiriou S.","2020","International Journal of STEM Education","39","Article","EN","Background: This study presents the development of three research tools of scientific creativity. Our aim is to evaluate the development of student creativity while students write digital stories. Three models are linked to create a new model, called Creative, Cognitive, Qualitative Model for Creativity (CCQ tool). Our research tool examines how creativity can be standardized, first by researchers’ views and then by teachers and students’ creative products. The first tool is based on two existing tools; the Scientific Creativity Structure Model (SCSM) and the TTCT Figural Subscales, and on new characteristics, the effective learning environments, as we have developed them in the CREATIONS Program. We have tried to expand this tool by combining its key elements to the theoretical framework of creativity, as we have approached it in the CREATIONS and the STORIES Programs. The second tool “Students’ Creativity Evaluation Model” is a new tool that derives from empirical data and Grounded Theory methods. It examines the expected, original, and innovative ways of students’ thinking. The third tool “Experts’ Creativity Evaluation Model” allows us to examine the role of experts thinking on writing a story. It aims at tracking experts’ model of thinking and is viewed in comparison to the students’ creative model of thinking. We create a qualitative tool as we believe that a qualitative method delves deeper into students’ internal mechanisms of creativity. Results: Twelve students’ stories from classrooms of different countries which participate to STORIES Program are analyzed indicatively by two independent researchers. The results seem to indicate that digital storytelling increases scientific creativity among students. Conclusions: The main difference between expert and students’ approaches is that experts’ stories follow an up to bottom approach, while it is the opposite for students’ creative process. It has to be mentioned that almost all of the stories combined science with creative thinking.

"STEAM education: student learning and transferable skills","Bertrand M.G.; Namukasa I.K.","2020","Journal of Research in Innovative Teaching and Learning","51","Article","EN","Purpose: Globally, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary learning in schools has become an increasingly popular and growing area of interest for educational reform. This prompts discussions about Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics (STEAM), which is shifting educational paradigms toward art integration in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects. Authentic tasks (i.e. real-world problems) address complex or multistep questions and offer opportunities to integrate disciplines across science and arts, such as in STEAM. The main purpose of this study is to better understand the STEAM instructional programs and student learning offered by nonprofit organizations and by publicly funded schools in Ontario, Canada. Design/methodology/approach: This study addresses the following research question: what interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary skills do students learn through different models of STEAM education in nonprofit and in-school contexts? We carried out a qualitative case study in which we conducted interviews, observations and data analysis of curriculum documents. A total of 103 participants (19 adults – director and instructors/teachers – and 84 students) participated in the study. The four STEAM programs comparatively taught both discipline specific and beyond discipline character-building skills. The skills taught included: critical thinking and problem solving; collaboration and communication; and creativity and innovation. Findings: The main findings on student learning focused on students developing perseverance and adaptability, and them learning transferable skills. Originality/value: In contrast to other research on STEAM, this study identifies both the enablers and the tensions. Also, we stress ongoing engagement with stakeholders (focus group), which has the potential to impact change in teaching and teacher development, as well as in related policies. © 2020, Marja G.

"Promoting STEAM learning in the early years: ""Pequeños Científicos"" Program","Cabello V.M.; Loreto Martínez M.; Armijo S.; Maldonado L.","2021","LUMAT","15","Article","EN","Education in the early years is an excellent space for promoting integrated learning. The STEAM education model combines Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics holistically and has gained force globally, mostly in developed countries. However, in developing countries of Latin America, STEAM education programs are incipient and still unfamiliar to many early childhood and primary school educators. ""Pequeños Científicos"" is a pioneer educational program in Chile aimed at providing extracurricular academic enrichment to students 3 to 10 years old, with a gender-empowering approach. With a cross-sectional design and integrating data from students, researchers and educators, this article documents program design and implementation issues based on a partial application of SWOT analysis grounded on strengths, weaknesses and opportunities. The strengths were identified the strongest elements that might be transferred to similar interventions, for instance, students were positively engaged in the learning processes and actively communicating their advances through diverse artistic formats. The weaknesses were mainly difficulties that can be prevented in future replication, such as teachers' management of children's behavior. Opportunities present alternatives to these types of programs to improve and grow; for example, through articulation of the courses and including children with additional needs. We call for tackling the weaknesses for more efficient application and discuss the promotion of STEAM learning in the early years in the contexts of high educational inequality for future replication in diverse contexts. © 2021 The Author(s)."

"Adopting creative pedagogy for STEAM education in technology enhanced environments","Yilmaz Y.C.","2021","CEUR Workshop Proceedings","0","Conference paper","EN","Employing an arts-integrated Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEAM) approach to education benefits the students by triggering creativity and innovative thinking. By teaching through STEAM, the teachers can better make connections between subjects and students understand the interconnectedness of those fields. Introducing creativity through the arts when teaching complex topics aids students in becoming creators of their knowledge, as they can explore ways to make connections between disciplines and obtain specific information by taking initiatives, individually or collaboratively. The idea of bringing together the creative approaches of learning, and taking ownership of the learning process initially requires a creative pedagogical approach. This approach of teaching to be creative is claimed to be one of the most successful ways of learning [1]. However, integrating creative pedagogy into technology became a necessity as technological advancements have been transforming the teaching and learning experiences. Intersecting the creative pedagogy (the arts in STEAM) and technology-enhanced learning establishes new outlets of interdisciplinary teaching and learning. The recent global COVID-19 pandemic has caused an abrupt transition to distance education that required the integration of technology and digital platforms into everyday teaching because teaching and learning have started to happen in online environments. Such transitions have inspired educators to notice that they could adopt digital interventions in their classrooms. This educational design research aims to further understand and develop a set of digital design principles that aims to bring together interdisciplinary topics of STEAM by utilizing arts. To illustrate and demonstrate different levels of uses of these design principles, a multi-layered digital structure will be built. The design process is planned to be co-created by high school teachers with the consideration of how we could help and support students with diverse backgrounds and interests, and teachers with different technical and artistic competencies. The expected result is theorization and the utilization of the design principles in integrating interdisciplinary subjects through arts. © 2020 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

"HeatQuiz: An app framework for game-based learning in STEM education","Jacobs E.; Garbrecht O.; Kneer R.; Rohlfs W.","2021","IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON","4","Conference paper","EN","The present paper aims to promote game-based learning using mobile apps in university-level education, specifically in the domains of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). A survey among 102 respondents determined needs and preferences of STEM students when using learning apps: which learning strategies they prefer, what personal motivation drives them, which gamification elements appeal to them, and which usage scenarios they favor. An important result is that students prefer apps which promote transfer of learning to those which help structure or memorize content. This preference is in line with the skills expected from professionals in this field. Concrete design and content guidelines for learning apps are derived. Following these, the authors developed a framework which other lecturers may use to create their own app. Two universally applicable types of tasks in STEM education are supported: One allows to qualitatively draw any two-dimensional mathematical function and check its characteristics; The other allows to correct any mathematical expression as variables can also be processed. Using the framework, a mobile app for heat and mass transfer (HeatQuiz App) was generated. The app was evaluated with STEM students in an undergraduate class: The vast majority gave a positive rating and believed that the focus on transfer of learning is well implemented. This is reflected in the usage statistic: During one semester, 545 different students played a total of 27, 350 games. As a measure of learning progress, the average score per game nearly tripled over the course of the class. While preparing for the exam, students pushed the app usage to a maximum of 10, 000 games per week. This illustrates that the app was well-accepted as a learning tool and is an ideal complement for teaching. © 2021 IEEE."

"The disciplinary borderlands of education: art and STEAM education (Los límites disciplinares de la educación: arte y educación STEAM)","Graham M.A.","2021","Infancia y Aprendizaje","14","Article","EN","The emphasis on STEM disciplines in schools has caused advocates for art education to propose the addition of the arts to the study of science, technology, engineering and mathematics, transforming STEM into STEAM. However, it is important that the larger purposes of art and education that have traditionally been embraced by the liberal arts are not lost in STEAM education and that the arts are not reduced to a role of cognitive enhancer for other STEM subjects. STEAM education is closely linked to ideas and research about arts integration and is often implemented using the methods of ‘design thinking’. The use of design thinking as a method for interdisciplinary collaboration has many connections to how STEAM education is practise d in schools. Research describing arts integration is also relevant to how art is included in STEAM education. This article describes rationales for STEAM education and how the work of contemporary artists provides generative examples of how STEAM education might be put into practice.

"Debugging by design: A constructionist approach to high school students' crafting and coding of electronic textiles as failure artefacts","Fields D.A.; Kafai Y.B.; Morales-Navarro L.; Walker J.T.","2021","British Journal of Educational Technology","27","Article","EN","Much attention in constructionism has focused on designing tools and activities that support learners in designing fully finished and functional applications and artefacts to be shared with others. But helping students learn to debug their applications often takes on a surprisingly more instructionist stance by giving them checklists, teaching them strategies or providing them with test programmes. The idea of designing bugs for learning—or debugging by design—makes learners agents of their own learning and, more importantly, of making and solving mistakes. In this paper, we report on our implementation of ‘Debugging by Design’ activities in a high school classroom over a period of 8 hours as part of an electronic textiles unit. Students were tasked to craft the electronic textile artefacts with problems or bugs for their peers to solve. Drawing on observations and interviews, we answer the following research questions: (1) How did students participate in making bugs for others? (2) What did students gain from designing and solving bugs for others? In the discussion, we address the opportunities and challenges that designing personally and socially meaningful failure artefacts provides for becoming objects-to-think-with and objects-to-share-with in student learning and promoting new directions in constructionism. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic There is substantial evidence for the benefits of learning programming and debugging in the context of constructing personally relevant and complex artefacts, including electronic textiles. Related, work on productive failure has demonstrated that providing learners with strategically difficult problems (in which they ‘fail’) equips them to better handle subsequent challenges. What this paper adds In this paper, we argue that designing bugs or ‘failure artefacts’ is as much a constructionist approach to learning as is designing fully functional artefacts. We consider how ‘failure artefacts’ can be both objects-to-learn-with and objects-to-share-with. We introduce the concept of ‘Debugging by Design’ (DbD) as a means to expand application of constructionism to the context of developing ‘failure artifacts’. Implications for practice and/or policy We conceptualise a new way to enable and empower students in debugging—by designing creative, multimodal buggy projects for others to solve. The DbD approach may support students in near-transfer of debugging and the beginning of a more systematic approach to debugging in later projects and should be explored in other domains beyond e-textiles. New studies should explore learning, design and teaching that empower students to design bugs in projects in mischievous and creative ways. © 2021 British Educational Research Association"

We conducted a summer teaching class about advanced manufacturing and 3D printing. The project is financed by NNSA (National Nuclear Security Administration), and the Department of Energy DOE. With our summer program, our objective is to serve advanced manufacturing, as evolving technology and to improve STEM education and prepare the new generation of high-school students (future engineers) by the use of the existing tools. Through the use of programs, such as CREO and Autodesk Inventor, as well as 3D printing concepts, we include both technology and basic traditional STEM knowledge, such as math and science. These tools allow the students to reach their objectives without going through complex mathematics and engineering concepts and methods. This way, these projects will mostly focus on critical thinking and the development of creative solutions to problems. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the design and implementation of an experiment, from basic parts. In particular, we will discuss several activities performed during this summer camp. This methodology is based on the understanding of the physical phenomena, perform experimentation, and the use of software, such as Autodesk Inventor. Our approach is based on active learning strategies, that emphasis comprehensive understanding, avoiding as possible all the complications of numerical and analytical mathematics needed for such level of study. Collaborations with high school instructors have been carried out and a methodology has been developed, based on a step by step learning method. At this moment, only two high-school instructors are involved. They enthusiastically help with the process, and at the same time, they are learning with the students, since they never had been exposed to such projects. Their presence was very useful in terms of addressing the appropriate pedagogy, communicating with high-school students, and controlling them in certain circumstances. Their presence is also available for the second explanation, where usually the first explanation from a university faculty is not completely appropriate with their level. Most importantly, the project methodology will be discussed. We discuss the project design program from students' point of view, and the experience earned in design, integration, and also in written and oral communication skills. The methodology used to evaluate the effectiveness of this design program in terms of learning outcomes is also described.

"Integrated activities in STEM environment: Methodology and implementation practice","Juškevičienė A.; Dagienė V.; Dolgopolovas V.","2021","Computer Applications in Engineering Education","19","Article","EN","Introduction: Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) and STEAM (with A for Arts) have evolved to symbolize the renewal of science education. STEAM education offers a number of benefits, such as improved problem analysis and solving skills, as well as the development of creative abilities. Many researchers reiterate the importance of STEAM-related activities and programs, especially the integration of maker education. Despite much interest in STEAM, it is often challenging for many educators to incorporate integrated activities into their teaching practice. This paper deals with the value of STEAM integration in a methodological sense, with a focus on the maker's laboratory and physical computing, as well as the application of design thinking and computational thinking approaches. Motivation and Objectives: The goal of this study is to develop a comprehensive conceptual framework for integrated STEM curricula focusing on the following research questions: (a) how to improve daily activities of STEM education by combining the activities of different laboratories and using a design thinking approach? and (b) how to combine FabLab activities and physical computing related to teaching different aspects of computational thinking in the context of STEM?. Research Methodology and Methods: As a research methodology, we implement a mixed methods strategy to combine theoretical study and empirical research based on a synthesized literature survey and the process of iterative model development based on an observational case study. We conduct a detailed case study of two applications of integrated activities based on FabLab and physical computing integration, and illustrate how design thinking can guide teachers to open up for interdisciplinary, creative, and project-based opportunities. Results and Findings: The paper provides a conceptual framework for STEM integration activities and step-by-step guidelines on how design thinking methods could could interact in practice. The implications of the results may be useful for educators seeking recommendations for the integration process, which enable educators to design hands-on activities and incorporate integrated aspect of students' STEAM learning into teaching practice. In conclusions, the authors suggest that as interdisciplinary crossroads, design thinking provides a natural bridge between subjects, and fits especially to integrate activities of the maker's labs and physical computing, focusing on the integration of computational thinking and computational making approaches within STEM education environment. The absence of a statistical evaluation, which is positioned as a further research step, may be mentioned as a limitation of the study. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC"

Despite positive developments in terms of CT integration into schools’ curricula, there are still important issues and challenges to address on how to teach and use programming and CT in the classrooms. As part of our ongoing efforts to introduce and to apply different maker technologies to foster CT, this paper describes the results of an exploratory study aiming at designing and implementing learning activities in informal settings using the Engino® Robotics Platform (ERP) and the BBC micro:bit. We conducted a one-week-long workshop with the participation of 22 children aged 10-15 years old. The constructionist theoretical perspective and the Four P’s Creative Learning theory (projects, peers, passion, and play) were applied for conceptualizing and designing our activities. The initial results of our efforts indicate that firstly, learning contexts enriched by the combination of different maker technologies can help students to develop CT skills; Secondly, remixing learning experiences can bring CT into STEM subjects; and lastly, the design of the proposed workshop and the planned activities serve as the basis of a learning environment that can foster problem solving, creativity, and heart-ware skills when the four P's are taken into account. The current study contributes with empirical knowledge that can be used for the advancement of design practices to promote CT development in connection to STEM-related subjects both in informal and formal learning settings. © 2021, The Education University of Hong Kong.

In this context the adoption of the Community of Practice (CoP) model can enhance the learning process. Although existing web portals provide STEM educational material and teamwork tools to active members they fall short to support state of the art trends in science education. To advance STEM education a fusion of diverse tools like learning management systems, computer-supported collaborative learning, online CoP management and contemporary technological platforms (e.g. Internet of Things, mobile and pervasive computing technologies) is advocated. This paper first identifies the common features required to build CoP enabled online platforms to support STEM education and classifies them in seven axes to form an evaluation framework for this domain. A comparative analysis of fifteen (15) STEM oriented web based platforms is conducted, based on features of the defined evaluation scheme. A critical presentation of their design characteristics is highlighted by exploring tools and services on the technology viewpoint and underpinning learning theories on the education viewpoint.

"Saudi Arabian science and mathematics teachers’ attitudes toward integrating STEM in teaching before and after participating in a professional development program","Aldahmash A.H.; Alamri N.M.; Aljallal M.A.; Bevins S.","2019","Cogent Education","26","Article","EN","For the advancement of current and future economic and overall well-being to occur, STEM professionals are highly needed. STEM education is an approach that integrates science, technology, engineering and mathematics curricula into one interdisciplinary curriculum. In the context of STEM education, learners acquire deep and critical thinking abilities, which help them become creative and analytic thinkers, and hence innovators in their careers. For this to happen, the teacher must be trained to successfully design and effectively teach an integrated STEM curriculum. The purpose of this study was to analyze Saudi Arabian science and mathematics teachers’ attitudes toward integrating Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) in teaching before and after they participated in a short professional development program focused on STEM integration in a specific middle school science and mathematics content. The participants were 48 Saudi Arabian science and mathematics teachers, who participated in a 6-day program held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The research methodology was a pretest–posttest one group (pre-experimental) design. The primary data source was the Instrument for Teachers’ Attitudes Toward Teaching Integrated STEM. The results indicate that Saudi Arabian science and mathematics teachers’ perceptions of difficulties decreased due to their participation in the professional development program on integrated STEM. Meanwhile, the teachers’ self-efficacy improved following their participation in the STEM professional development (PD) program. However, no perceived effect was found for the teachers’ perceptions of the relevance of or their anxiety about or enjoyment of Integrated STEM teaching due to their participation in the 6-day PD program. We argue that Engaging teachers in integrated STEM professional development may improve their attitudes toward and increase their interest in teaching this approach. To improve teachers’ attitudes toward, it is suggested that future PD programs should be long and continuous, and focus on training science and mathematics teachers to teach integrated STEM subjects. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

This paper uses the literature analysis method to sort out the current research status and hotspots of the current Steam class design and teaching application. It is also proposed to combine the strengths of gamification teaching, and to drive the project-driven and task-oriented design of the Steam lesson to be closer to the game, whether or not it contains modern technology. Combined with relevant theories, this paper attempts to construct a design model of steam teaching activity based on gamification task orientation, and describes the design and practice process of the successful case of the fifth grade primary school campus sand table. After the course, the questionnaire and interview method will be used to understand the teaching effect of the steam class. The results show that the teaching mode is effective in primary school classroom teaching, which can enhance students' enthusiasm for learning and provide a better learning experience. It is expected that the case in this study will provide a reference for steam education researchers in practical exploration. © 2019 International Conference on Computers in Education, Proceedings.All right reserved."

"Development and application of a novel engineering-based maker education course for pre-service teachers","Kim J.-Y.; Chung H.; Young Jung E.; Kim J.-O.; Lee T.-W.","2020","Education Sciences","10","Article","EN","This study aimed to raise awareness of maker education for pre-service teachers and discuss maker education in their major subjects by developing and applying a maker education course for pre-service teachers with various majors based on novel engineering (NE), a teaching and learning method that combines humanities and engineering. Accordingly, the course was developed following the procedure of the Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation (ADDIE) model, and the educational effectiveness was investigated using test tools. The educational effect and difficulties were also examined through the analysis of reflective journals written by 20 pre-service teachers with various majors who participated in the course. To investigate the educational effectiveness of the developed course, the science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) literacy of the participants—before and after the course—was measured, with the results demonstrating a statistically significant improvement. Analysis of the reflective journals identified a recognition of sharing effectiveness, the joy of making, and an in-depth understanding of maker education as education effects, and a lack of understanding of techniques, the burden of prototype fabrication, and the limitation of majoring subjects as diffculties experienced during the activities. This study verified that NE could be used as a significant maker education measure for pre-service teachers with various majors. Based on this verification, this study also proposes a strategy to develop more effective NE-based maker education. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."
"Analysis of relationships among science contestants’ cooperation attitude, knowledge sharing, and continuous sharing intention","Hon J.-C.; Ye J.-H.; Ho Y.-J.; Lin I.-C.","2020","Bulletin of Educational Psychology","2","Article","Chinese","With science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) education in full swing worldwide, several science competitions based on STEAM have sprung up. One is Maker-Highlight-STEM&A, a competition sponsored by the Department of Education of the Taipei City Government, which involves STEAM learning and creativity through hands-on skills. In Maker- Highlight-STEM&A project making, knowledge sharing is crucial for seeking approaches to solve problems. Participants must know how to collaborate with each other and have a positive collective attitude to knowledge sharing to achieve the team’s goals. In particular, in the competition, the project topic is given on the spot, which encourages participants to share their knowledge and discover new ideas while creating project functions and improving their project quality, thereby helping them win the competition. Extending Kahneman’s (2003) dual process system, which states that automatic and reflective responses exist in knowledge sharing, we divided reflective responses into rational and emotional responses based on the cognition-affection model. To analyze the role of the three types of knowledge sharing, this study explored cooperative attitude as their antecedent and continuous intention as their predictor. In the highly competitive environment of Maker-Highlight-STEM&A, knowledge sharing in teamwork is crucial to win the competition; however, few studies have examined the correlation among cooperative attitude, knowledge sharing, and continuous intention to share knowledge. Because self-identity can foster attitudes toward a behavior in relation to the intention to perform that behavior, the present study considered the self-identity of participants in three types of knowledge sharing to predict their continuous intention to share knowledge in the competition. Group interactions can affect people’s motivation to share their knowledge. Thus, this research built a research model extended from trait activation theory and social sharing motivation theory. With cooperative attitude as an independent variable, knowledge sharing as an intervening variable, and continuous sharing intention as a dependent variable, we proposed the following six research hypotheses: H1: Cooperative attitude is positively associated with autonomous response. H2: Cooperative attitude is positively associated with rational reflection. H3: Cooperative attitude is positively associated with emotional reflection. H4: Autonomous response is positively associated with continuous sharing intention. H5: Rational reflection is positively associated with continuous intention to share knowledge. H6: Emotional reflection is negatively associated with continuous sharing intention. The purposive sampling technique was used in this research wherein all participants in the 2018 Maker-Highlight- STEM&A were invited to fill out a questionnaire survey. A total of 219 questionnaires were collected, of which 50 invalid questionnaires (with incomplete data) were excluded, leaving 169 effective samples for an effective rate of 77.2% and including 102 male (60.4%) and 67 female (39.6%) respondents. By performing the first-order confirmatory factor analysis, questionnaire items with lower factor loadings were deleted. Then, the reliability and validity of the questionnaire constructs were tested to ensure they met the thresholds of statistical standards. Model fit and path analyses were performed to verify the research model. When performing the first-order confirmatory factor analysis to evaluate the internal validity of items in each construct, items with residual values over 0.5 should be removed from the original questionnaire (Hair et al., 2018). In the original questionnaire, there were 11 items for cooperative attitude; five each for autonomous response, rational reflection, and emotional reflection; and five for the continuous sharing intention construct. Of the remaining items, those for cooperative attitude were reduced from 11 to six; those for autonomous response, rational reflection, and emotional reflection were reduced from five to four each; and those for continuous sharing intention were reduced from five to four. Exemplary items included “If my teammates have trouble shooting, I will help him or her right away” for measuring the cooperative attitude construct, with CR =.89 and Cronbach’s α =.90; “If any idea comes to my mind, I speak out right away” for measuring the automatic response construct, with CR =.84 and Cronbach’s α =.83; “If any idea comes to my mind, I determine whether it is rational before speaking out” for measuring the rational reflection response construct, with CR =.89 and Cronbach’s α =.89; “If any idea comes to my mind, I think about whether it will be rejected before I speak out” for measuring emotional reflection, with CR =.86 and Cronbach’s α =.86; and “I would like to continuously share knowledge in this type of contest in the future” for measuring continuous sharing intention, with CR =.94 and Cronbach’s α =.94. The CR and Cronbach’s α values were above the threshold suggested by Hair et al. (2018), indicating that the composite reliability and internal consistency of the questionnaire were acceptable. In this research, having a cooperative attitude was the independent variable, the three different types of knowledge sharing were mediating variables, and continuous sharing intention was the dependent variable. Data were analyzed and tested using structural equation modeling with AMOS 20.0. The results of the data analysis revealed that cooperative attitude was positively associated with autonomous response, rational reflection, and emotional reflection. Moreover, autonomous response was negatively associated with continuous sharing intention; rational reflection was positively associated with continuous sharing intention; and emotional reflection was negatively associated with continuous sharing intention. Throughout the competition, there were numerous benefits for participants apart from the purpose of the competition itself, including teamwork and knowledge sharing. Despite the fact that it is important to know how to effectively improve students’ knowledge sharing through such events, it has seldom been mentioned in research related to science competitions; hence, we conducted an empirical study targeting the 2018 science competition. The research results revealed that all three knowledge sharing types, namely autonomous response, rational reflection, and emotional reflection, played a positive predictive role in cooperative attitude. Emotional response and automatic reaction played a negative antecedent role in continuous intention to share knowledge. In line with the CHsaying “thinking three times before taking action,” we should focus on knowledge sharing from rational reflection and deactivate knowledge sharing from emotional reflection and automatic response to improve knowledge transmission effects for participants to experience a more meaningful STEAM process. Remarkably little research has been conducted on learners’ knowledge sharing behavior in school and even less on such behavior in competitions. This research revealed that a competition involving teamwork, the behavioral model of knowledge sharing, and the intention of continuous sharing can be expanded to understand cooperative learning in any other STEAM-related contests. In addition, this study proposed three different types of knowledge sharing (i.e., autonomous response, rational reflection, and emotional reflection) extended from Kahneman’s dual-process theory (intuitive feedback and reflective feedback) to review continuous sharing intention. These three knowledge sharing types could be a reference for future research teams to improve knowledge-sharing effects in other cooperative settings. Onsite team competitions promote cooperative opportunities for participants to develop their attitude to collaborative work and knowledge sharing in rational reflection. Cooperative attitude development is essential for meeting the requirement of new 108 curricula. In line with this, other types of science or STEAM contests can integrate onsite activities to ensure that participants must work collaboratively to win the contest. In particular, National Science Fair or Science Olympic contests can be implemented with trouble shooting onsite, in which effective knowledge sharing can be embedded along with project making. © 2020, National Taiwan Normal University.

"STEAM for space leaders of tomorrow: Human-systems integration as a technique and an art","Boy G.A.","2019","New Space","0","Article","EN","Human-systems integration (HSI) is progressively becoming a central discipline. HSI is grounded on the coconstruction of technology, organizations, and people's activities and jobs. HSI also requires the association of physics, cognitive engineering, and arts. Physics provides necessary knowledge, rules, and constraints that an engineer needs to build a system that works. Cognitive engineering provides knowledge, rules, and constraints that are necessary to safely, efficiently, and comfortably use a system. However, neither physics nor cognitive engineering provides insights or methods that support creativity. Consequently, arts should be integrated into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) to make STEAM (with an ""A"" for arts). In this article, integration will be presented as creativity and abduction. Visualization supports integration by making abstract constructs more tangible and facilitating effective learning. We will see how during the design of what became NASA Space Exploration Vehicle, we worked with artists and cartoonists, who helped us visualize possible scenarios. They first drew cartoons that were displayed around a room and developed animations. We used them not only as tangible visualizations of our concepts but also as mediating representations that integrated multiple participants' views. This article is also based on the experience of International Space University Space Studies Program 2012 where we carried out a project on ""what space can contribute to global STEM education,"" which clearly anticipated the shift from STEM to STEAM. We will advocate that space leaders of tomorrow should physically, cognitively, and creatively investigate a specific planet, that is Earth in addition to the other planets. This development is true for both governmental and commercial space activities. We will conclude on the fact that HSI is both a technique and an art, and qualifies for being a STEAM discipline. © Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019."

"Innowiz: Design sprinting for secondary schools","Willems L.; Laperre D.","2019","Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education: Towards a New Innovation Landscape, E and PDE 2019","0","Conference paper","EN","INNOWIZ (innovation wizard) is an easy to learn creativity method that on one hand helps chaotic people to find structure and deliver on time, and on the other hand helps structured people to experiment more and spice up their ideas. The method and supportive tools are designed to allow a personal approach and use. Since 2009 INNOWIZ is integrated in different bachelor programmes (industrial product design, communication management, tourism, architecture, journalism, physiotherapy, …) at HOWEST and other university colleges in Belgium, The Netherlands, Spain, USA, and China. Since 2014 Howest Industrial Design Center (IDC) delivers INNOWIZ-based services in research projects, innovation studies and processes in the making industry for universities, companies and organisations. In 2012 the Flemish Government decides to write a STEAM-chapter with 8 goals to achieve before 2020. It announced a new approach in education and launched different calls for innovation. HOWEST and especially IDC were asked to transfer their knowledge in design thinking and applied creativity, which lead to several new tools and support for secondary schools, their staff and pupils: INNOWIZ TEMPLATE SET: Based on the 4 steps INNOWIZ methodology – (1) problem definition, (2) idea generation, (3) idea selection, (4) idea communication – the INNOWIZ template set provides 12 templates in each step to help pupils to get started in their project with a creative approach. With a minimum of explication and a maximum of freedom, they learn how to find solutions by iteration. It helps them to get started as problem solvers and become familiar with open projects and wicked problems. ONO STEAMKIT: ONO is an abbreviation for ‘Onderzoekend eN Ontwerpend leren’ (Dutch), and can be translated as ‘learning by research and design’. The ONO steamkit supports a group of teachers to think about project work that transcend the boundaries of courses and to discuss about teaching formats and the freedom-to-operate for their pupils. Based on divergent and convergent thinking it allows teachers to get prepared for their role as coach and concurs the threshold to get started with project based learning. After thoroughly testing in different types of schools, both tools have shown that the integration of applied creativity and the independence of high school pupils in the approach of the project effectively improve their motivation to bring the project to a successful solution. Not only the students, but also their teachers have experienced a positive effect while using the tools. Interdisciplinary teams can now, with help of the ONO-kit, organise their meetings in a clear and visually communicative way, so all teachers can agree upon the project, its boundaries and the participation of their pupils. This paper will explain the tools, show how to use and reflect on the first effects on users and projects. © 2019 Institution of Engineering Designers, The Design Society. All rights reserved."

The new educational model at Tecnologico de Monterrey, known as Tec21 and based on competencies, has left behind the educational model based on objectives. As part of its pedagogical support, the new model has considered two kind of competencies: The transversal competencies such as collaboration, problem solution, ethical analysis, leadership, innovation & critical thinking; and the disciplinaries competencies, for example, statistics, quality control, design of experiments, inventory control, planning, forecasting, for mention some academic areas. Competency-based learning curricular design in this educational model is necessary to transfer knowledge to students through academic activities schemed specially for it. In the Industrial Engineering and Design teamwork, we are using the play lab concepts to build academic activities with interactivity between the academic and the industry ecosystem. To design activities that represent a challenge for the students, designer teachers are using Meccano, a metal constructive game base in STEAM education. Meccano are an approach to learning, and access points for guiding student inquiry, dialogue, and critical thinking. To make the learning process more interesting, STEAM teachers, with high academic background, transfer knowledge to the student making use of their creativity to design an academic practice both interest and attractive for students.

"STEAM education for preschool students: Patterns, activity designs and effects","Bureekhampun S.; Mungmee T.","2020","Journal for the Education of Gifted Young Scientists","5","Article","EN","Organizing STEAM educational activities which integrate different knowledge areas in order to create an innovation for primary school students that uses many skills is difficult. This is because children aged 6 are different in terms of intelligence, skills and mood. There is a lack of a set of activities that make students happily learn together by playing and get involved with creative and innovative thinking, practice planning and decision skills, and work together as a team. Therefore, encouragement is needed to create a set of learning activities by applying the STEAM educational concept and to evaluate their learning success also using the STEAM educational concept. The result of this set of activities was the design of three different moveable robot inspired by a breed of dog called Beagle. The Beagle set of activities were then evaluated by three experts in the area. The outcome was that the first design had the highest mean (X= 4.88, S.D. = 0.17). The mean from the structure & control system evaluation of this set of activities was at a very good level (X=4.83, S.D.= 0.39). Finally, the learning achievement from using this set of STEAM educational activities with the sample had a mean of 16.07, which is 80.33 %. This means that the proposed set of activities is able to help students to improve the process of their thought.

It argues that this will help students further their understanding of analytical concepts through the use of creativity. The authors illustrate how schools can work towards presenting common practices, concepts, and content. Coverage features case studies and lessons learned from classrooms across the United States. The notion of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) is an emerging discipline unique in its desire to provide a well-rounded approach to education. The chapters of this volume examine STEAM in a variety of settings, from kindergarten to higher education. Readers will learn about the practical considerations involved when introducing the arts and creativity into traditionally left brain processes. This includes best practices for creating and sustaining successful STEAM initiatives in any school, college, or university. For instance, one chapter discusses novel approaches to teach writing with the scientific method in order to help students better present their ideas. The authors also detail how the arts can engage more diverse learners, including students who are not traditionally interested in STEM subjects. They provide three concrete examples of classroom-tested inquiries: designing a prosthetic arm for a child, making a paleontology investigation, and taking a closer look at the arts within roller coaster engineering. This book is an invaluable resource for teachers and teacher trainers, university faculty, researchers, and school administrators. It will also be of interest to science, mathematics, engineering, computer science, information technology, arts and design and technology teachers. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019."

We note that STEAM is broader than mere arts integration in STEM. It reflects a view of education that is more creative, real-world-driven, and problem- or project-based in nature. To develop learning content and experiences that offer creative, authentic, real-world, and problem- or project-driven focus, teachers need more than an argument—they need a guiding framework. We suggest that design and design thinking are natural areas of interconnection with STEAM, both for learners and teachers. These ideas can be used to frame STEAM-based experiences that are more open, creative, project-based, and real-world-driven. Here, we discuss the nature of the connections between design and STEAM and focus on how teachers can use design thinking practices to help them redesign curriculum to transition from STEM to STEAM. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019."

"Art as a point of departure for understanding student experience in learning to code","Dahn M.; DeLiema D.; Enyedy N.","2020","Teachers College Record","9","Article","EN","Background/Context: Computer science has been making its way into K–12 education for some time now. As computer science education has moved into learning spaces, research has focused on teaching computer science skills and principles but has not sufficiently explored the emotional aspects of students’ experiences. This topic warrants further study because learning to code is a complex emotional experience marked by intense periods of success and failure. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: The purpose of our study is to understand how reflecting on and making art might support students’ emotional experience of learning to code. We focus our efforts on students’ experiences with debugging, the process of figuring out how to fix broken code. Our research questions are: How did students reflect on their experiences and emotions in the context of art making about debugging? How did students describe the potential for making art to shape their coding practice? Setting: The setting is a two-week computer programming workshop at a non-profit organization focused on computer science education. Population/Participants/Subjects: Participants are 5th through 10th grade students attending Title I schools or with demonstrated financial need. Intervention/Program/Practice: Students participated in a visual arts class for an hour each day of the two-week workshop, in addition to three coding classes. Research Design: Design-based research anchored our study. Data sources included students’ written artist statements, artifact-based interviews about artwork, and in-process conversations with the researcher-teacher leading the art class. We used a storytelling framework to make sense of how elements of our curriculum and instructional design supported student reflections on obstacles in coding, how they talked about debugging events over time, and the range of emotions they expressed feeling. Findings/Results: Findings suggest that making and reflecting on art can support students in offering descriptive accounts of learning to code and debug. Students’ stories highlighted the range of ways they experienced failure in coding, the causes of those moments of failure, the flow of events through failure (what was disrupted, how the experience changed over time, and whether it was resolved), and the emotions (about emotions) that framed failure. Moreover, students described the ways that art making shaped their coding practice, including transforming how they understood themselves, set goals, relaxed after a stressful coding class, approached problem solving, and set expectations. Conclusions/Recommendations: Our results have implications for the redesign of our intervention and more broadly for the design of learning environments and computer science pedagogy. © 2020 Teachers College, Columbia University.

It is especially important to solve this problem when educating the prospective specialists of the science and technology area.The need to develop young adults' creative thinking skills is also topical. The effectiveness of the laboratory works in chemistry of the future biologists and optometry specialists was researched implementing the learning outcomes-based approach. The aim of the research is to find out how the depth of cognitive learning affects the first year students' learning. The research is focused on students' constructivist learning and the development of their logic-mathematical thinking. Tests checking the students' knowledge were developed applying a modified Bloom's taxonomy. These tests were used to check the students' knowledge and skills after doing the laboratory work. The research participants were 74 biology and optometry first year students. The test results provide a feedback for students and thus create a possibility to adjust the teaching-learning process. SPSS programme was used for statistic processing of the research findings. It can be concluded that only one third of the students are able to demonstrate the skill to analyse and evaluate attaining the learning outcomes that correspond to the university requirements. Questions of logic-mathematical character, noticing the causes of possible mistakes and evaluation of one's own work create the main difficulties for students. Learning outcomes are closely connected with the depth of the students' cognitive activity, as it is proved by statistically significant differences among high performing, middle performing and low performing students. © 2019 Latvia University of Agriculture.

"Technological education and engineering pedagogy","Danilaev D.P.; Malivanov N.N.","2020","Obrazovanie i Nauka","15","Article","RU","Introduction. Technological education, being a part of the school curriculum, is presented as a factor and a means of students' socialisation and as ""a process and a result of active learning by schoolchildren the general and professional technological culture, general and special ways of technological transformation of reality, and the development of technological competency and creative abilities of a person""1. However, over the past decade, the goals of this type of education have undergone several changes: in high-technology competitive world, the priority is given to the development of ""universal digital literacy"", which affected the content of teachers' work. The peculiarity of a teacher's work in the considered professional and pedagogical activity is the integration of pedagogical, psychological and technicaltechnological components. Currently, there is increased deficit of qualified techno- logy teachers. The modern system of teacher education does not imply fundamental technical training and the training of technical specialists does not require the formation of psychological and pedagogical competencies. The approaches to solve the problem can be drawn from the theory and practical application of vocational pedagogy. Primarily, engineering pedagogy is intended to ensure the quality of personnel of teaching community in engineering institutions. The aim of the present article is to justify the appropriateness of using the methodology of engineering pedagogy in the training of teachers of technological education and the need for expanding of relevant educational programmes in graduate school and in the continuing education system in technical universities. Methodology and research methods. The research was based on the following methodology: the provisions of professionology; systematic analysis of applied aspects of engineering pedagogy; the principle of convergence, defining interdisciplinary and supra-professional relationships, contributes to the design and promotion of the transprofessional nature of actors; the main principle of operation and development of the system of vocational and pedagogical training and advanced training of teachers (including technology teachers) - synchronised content of teaching with scientific, technical and technological innovations. Results and scientific novelty. The authors show the relationship between engineering and technological education goals, based on shared general activity nature. Scientific grounds for the development of engineering pedagogy in terms of training of teachers of technology are identified. The triplicity of such training is demonstrated: the qualification required to be a technology teacher implies possession of effective educational methods, knowledge of child psychology and competences in the field of modern digital technologies and technological equipment. The constantly growing level of knowledge intensity of the latter and the specific intertwining of humanitarian, natural science and applied components in the work of the technology teacher show that the system of his or her continuing education, retraining and advanced training should be organised. On the basis of the technical specialty received earlier, the opportunities of such an organisation, including technical universities, are presented. One effective option could be the development of a digital cluster - a platform, which integrates the resources of educational institutions of different stages, production structures, as well as enterprises of medium and small business. The operation of this cluster will contribute to the rapid spread of modern technologies and it will provide their accessibility and continuity of technological education in school, as well as in secondary vocational and higher education. The common information space will ensure to provide the coordination of instrumental training elements, to compare methods and develop personality- oriented approaches with the help of distance technologies. In addition, the digital cluster can serve as a mechanism for selection and retraining of teac hers of universities, technical schools and technology teachers through the formation of a database providing information on mentors with unique competencies. Practical significance. The authors believe that the present research could be useful for the development of alternative methods and forms of training of vocational and pedagogical personnel. © 2020 RU State Vocational Pedagogical University.

"Escape room design as a game-based learning process for steam education","Karageorgiou Z.; Mavrommati E.; Fotaris P.","2019","Proceedings of the European Conference on Games-based Learning","25","Conference paper","EN","By combining elements of entertainment with creative writing, theater and technology, the increasingly popular live-action games escape rooms have the potential to improve the learning experience when used in academic settings. However, since educational escape rooms are still an emerging field, there is limited literature available about their use in STEAM education. The present paper addresses this issue by describing the methods followed by 39, 16 to 18-year-old, students and 10 teachers at a Vocational School of Greece to implement a STEAM-focused escape room activity using the Experiential Pyramid Model. The escape room was themed after the ES heist television series “La Casa de Papel” and incorporated creative writing, theatrical elements, and technology, such as Robotics, QR codes and Virtual Reality (VR), to promote communication, teamwork and peer learning. To make the experience more immersive, two team members had the roles of non-player characters (NPCs), and interacted with the players throughout the game, with a small script written during the design and evaluation phase. This collaborative activity was assessed via evaluation questionnaires, direct/participatory observation and interviews. The first results indicated that students were highly engaged and motivated especially at the design phase. They valued this pedagogical approach positively, since it facilitated the integration of contents of various subjects and enabled them to collaborate with their peers from different cohorts, thus promoting peer learning. This study aims to provide educators with an example of how they might develop and support non-traditional approaches to learning by immersing their students as active participants in the learning environment and allowing them to develop and apply knowledge, so to create a gameplay. © The Authors, 2019.

"Using improvisational acting techniques to improve the oral communication skills of STEM graduate students","LaMeres B.J.; Hughes B.E.; Organ C.O.","2019","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings","0","Conference paper","EN","Members of the STEM workforce are notorious for lacking the ability to describe their work to people outside of their narrow fields. This primarily results from a lack of training in oral communication that focuses on how to communicate with the public. Graduate students do not receive extensive opportunities to practice the communication skills crucial for effective professionals. Most communication experience in graduate school comes in the form of presenting at technical conferences or presenting their work to their peers. The resulting inability to communicate effectively, and communicate to a wider audience, contributes to the void in scientific engagement of our citizens. As a long-term consequence, our broader society does not understand the importance of STEM and in turn, does not strongly support nor champion STEM-related policies. To meet the grand challenges that face our population, we need a STEM workforce with exceptional communication skills, as well as a society that understands and supports large scale initiatives to spur STEM innovation and bolster STEM education. This paper presents a novel oral communication curriculum that is being developed and tested at Montana State University (MSU). The program, called the “STEM Storytellers Program”, uses a transformative approach to training graduate students that pulls knowledge from the journalism and performing arts community. Our program has three specific components: (1) creating jargon-less podcasts; (2) receiving training from an improvisational actor on stage presence; and (3) presenting at “curiosity cafes” to audiences from the general public. This paper will present the design of the curriculum including the overarching theoretical framework, programmatic issues, and recruiting. This paper will be of interest to faculty that wish to improve graduate student oral communication skills and are seeking novel programs that are being pilot tested at other universities. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019"

"Fashion fundamentals: Fostering educational and socialpsychological growth for middle school girls through an unconventional stem learning program","Ogle J.P.; Hyllegard K.H.; Park J.","2019","Journal of Women and Minorities in Science and Engineering","1","Article","EN","With this work, we explore outcomes of participation in Fashion FUNdamentals (FF), a STEM summer enrichment program designed exclusively for middle school girls which is grounded in worldview theory and research on the maker movement suggesting that adolescent girls’ “passion for fashion” can be harnessed to build their interest and skills in the STEM disciplines and to nurture their selfconfidence and self-esteem. Data were collected via focus groups with 69 girls who had participated in the program. Eight focus groups were conducted across three summers (2015–2017), and participants ranged in age from 10 to 13 (mean age = 11.3 years). The qualitative data were analyzed using constant comparison processes. Analyses revealed that girls perceived that participating in the STEM program shaped them in four primary ways: (a) expanding their understanding of the global textile and apparel industry as a STEM-based discipline, (b) enriching their understanding of conventional STEM disciplines, (c) building a foundation for personal/social-psychological well-being, and (d) building a foundation for academic and professional success. Additionally, because the focus group methodology is well-suited for delineating a diversity of participant experiences, we identified a fifth theme: (e) revealing trials encountered as a program participant and opportunities to strengthen the program. Taken together, the findings provide support for the central premise of worldview theory and findings from research on the maker movement, namely, that STEM learning can be fostered by linking educational content to subjects—such as art, craft, design, and fashion—that girls often find to be personally meaningful and engaging. © 2019 by Begell House, Inc."

"A methodology for the analysis of block-based programming languages appropriate for children","Kraleva R.; Kralev V.; Kostadinova D.","2019","Journal of Computing Science and Engineering","17","Article","EN","Nowadays, the interest of young people in programming is decreasing steadily on a global scale. This, however, is becoming a problem for global economic development. The dynamic development of technologies requires implementation of new teaching and learning methods. As a result, new Computer Science courses related to programming in primary education have been introduced. Pupils learn the basics and the programming skills using new visual programming languages known as block-based programming languages that allow the design of programming algorithms (program logic) using drag-and-drop of program chunks, named blocks. This makes the programming languages easy to use even by young children. The lack of a reasonable argument for the choice of block-based programming languages based on their functional characteristics, interface and children's preference prompted this investigation. This article discusses some of the modern block-based programming languages. Research into the state-of-the-art scientific publications on this issue has been done. The criteria for comparing and analyzing these programming languages have been defined. As a result, the blockbased programming languages that best meet the criteria have been identified. Two languages (Scratch and Code.org) have been selected based on the proposed methodology. These languages were used for two weeks by pupils in the 3rd and 4th grades in Bulgaria. The main goal of this study is to determine the degree of similarity between block-based and traditional programming languages, as well as discuss the opportunity for their use in the Bulgarian primary school. The proposed methodology can be easily adapted and used in other countries. An important factor in this research is the support available in the pupils' native language for the integrated development environment and programming languages. © 2019.

Calling for “continuation of life on the planet, making our world more sustainable, secure, healthy, and joyful,” this document inspired a global movement urging interdisciplinary thinkers, policymakers, and the general public around the world to come together to address challenges facing humanity. As a part of this global movement, academic institutions responded by creating a Grand Challenges Scholars Program (GCSP), an initiative that complements and extends engineering education to include knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behaviors necessary to solve grand challenges outlined in NAE's report. The GCSP is a framework that defines five competencies (Talent, Multicultural, Multidisciplinary, Entrepreneurship, and Social Consciousness), development of which serves to prepare a student to address NAE's Grand Challenges. These five competencies necessitate a holistic approach to educating next generation global citizens, not just next generation engineers. As the program continues to grow, increasing numbers of scholars delve into the questions pertaining to the effectiveness of GCSP on improving students' learning outcomes. However, not much is yet known about the ways in which students, both engineering and non-engineering, make sense of the ways in which GCSP supports their holistic growth and development into global citizens of tomorrow. Through this panel discussion and paper, we bring together GCSP Scholars from four different institutions funded by the Teagle Foundation to explicitly bridge liberal arts and STEM education through GCSP. The participating institutions - Olin College of Engineering (Olin), Lawrence Technological University (LTU), Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), and Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) - represent diverse academic and institutional cultures and are at different stages of GCSP development, with Olin being one of the founding GCSP schools and LTU being the newest addition to the national program. The panelists, both engineering and non-engineering majors as well as those early in their GCSP career and GCSP alumni, share their stories and critically reflect on the pathways which GCSP presented for them.

Production of a diverse generation of human resources with relevant, competitive skills is critical. However, so too is the need to raise an enlightened citizenry with cross-cultural experience and cultural awareness competency, with a broad worldview and global perspectives. These requirements are critical to understanding the challenges and opportunities of scholarly activity in a pluralistic global environment and positioning ourselves to capitalize upon them. Scholars with cross-cultural experience and competency are empowered to adapt and work collaboratively, nationally and globally, with scholars of different races, geopolitical, socioeconomic, and cultural backgrounds. Development of effective strategies to transform science,technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) departments for inclusion and to broaden the participation in STEM across cultures, socioeconomic standing, race, and gender in higher education has been a dominant topic of pedagogical interest of national priority in the last several decades. However, success in these endeavors is achievable only through systemic change and a cultural shift to address the underlying root causes of socioeconomic disparity, gender, and racial disparities and a paucity of cultural awareness among all educational stakeholders. STEM departments can only be truly transformed for inclusion through the development of sensitive, creative, and student-engaging curricula and targeted recruitment and retention of underrepresented minorities in STEM. Formation of well-coordinated alliances spanning educational sectors, governmental and non-governmental organizations, and community engagement and outreach are also critical to promoting inclusive and broad participation in STEM education. The first section of the chapter gives an introduction to various challenges, obstacles, and hindrances that prevent a successful transformation of K_12 science education as well as STEM departments in higher education for inclusion. The second section discusses historical perspectives of the University of Arkansas-Fort Smith (UAFS) _ the institutional profile, missions, and visions of UAFS as a regional university. Policies and strategies for addressing the socioeconomic disparity, faculty gender, and racial disparities and cultural competency awareness at UAFS are also highlighted in this section. Other approaches including targeted efforts to recruit and retain underrepresented minority students, provision of financial assistance for students from low-income families, and a creative “Math-up” curriculum innovation to promote inclusive and broad participation in STEM at UAFS are highlighted in the latter section of the chapter. Formation of alliances between UAFS, local K_12 school districts, and governmental and non-governmental agencies to promote broad participation in STEM at UAFS are discussed.

"The student-self oriented learning model as an effective paradigm for education in knowledge society","Fomichov V.A.; Fomichova O.S.","2019","Informatica (Slovenia)","7","Article","EN","Proceeding from broadly accepted role of emotional intelligence (EI) in professional and personal life, the paper suggests a new learning model (LM) called Student-Self Oriented LM (SSOL-model). It is defined as the model being beneficial for self-cognition and self-construction through the prism of the acquired knowledge and life experience. Two successful implementations of the SSOL-model are shortly described: the system of emotional-imaginative teaching (the EIT-system) developed by the authors in the 1990s and expanded in the 2000s and art cognitonics. The EIT-system is underpinned by the authors’ Theory of Dynamic Conceptual Mappings (the DCM-theory). The EIT-system includes an original method of developing figurative thinking and creativity at the lessons of second language (EN for RU children), literature and poetry in EN and RU, symbolic language of painting, and communication culture. It is stated that this method may be used as an effective starting framework of STEAM education. It is mentioned that the DCM-theory and the EIT-system became the starting point for developing the foundations of a new scientific discipline called cognitonics. The basic principles of art cognitonics – a well developed branch of cognitonics and the concept of cognitive engagement are described. The significance of art cognitonics for helping the learners to answer the encountered moral questions is explained. The broad possibilities of designing intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) of new generation are indicated. These are culture and moral experience oriented systems aimed at developing figurative thinking, creativity, early socialization and helping the students to find in the outstanding art works the answers to emerging moral questions. An original, detailed script of an ITS contributing to early socialization of the learners is described, its literary source is the fairy-tale ""Sleeping Beauty"". Since the sphere of using the SSOL-model is not restricted, it is suggested to interpret this model as an effective paradigm for education in knowledge society and a strong support to anthropocentric approach to education in the digital age. © 2019 Slovene Society Informatika.

"Cases on models and methods for STEAM education","Bazler J.A.; van Sickle M.L.","2019","Cases on Models and Methods for STEAM Education","1","Book","EN","STEAM education can be described in two ways. One model emphasizes the arts and is not as concerned about the accuracy of the STEM fields. In the second model, STEM content is the prevailing force with a focus on accuracy, and the arts are used in limited and secondary resources for the teaching of the content. However, in order to promote creative thinking, allow for higher student engagement, and offer a more well-rounded education, a STEAM model, where science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics are equal contributors to the process of learning, is needed. Cases on Models and Methods for STEAM Education is an important scholarly resource that provides inclusive models and case studies highlighting best techniques and practices for implementing STEAM models in teaching and assists teachers as they learn to use such methods through the inclusion of practical activities for use in the classroom. Highlighting a wide range of topics such as science education, fine arts, and teaching models, this book is essential for educators, administrators, curriculum developers, instructional designers, policymakers, academicians, researchers, and students. © 2020 by IGI Global.

"Educing AI-thinking in science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) education","How M.-L.; Hung W.L.D.","2019","Education Sciences","66","Article","EN","In science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) education, artificial intelligence (AI) analytics are useful as educational scaffolds to educe (draw out) the students’ AI-Thinking skills in the form of AI-assisted human-centric reasoning for the development of knowledge and competencies. This paper demonstrates how STEAM learners, rather than computer scientists, can use AI to predictively simulate how concrete mixture inputs might affect the output of compressive strength under different conditions (e.g., lack of water and/or cement, or different concrete compressive strengths required for art creations). To help STEAM learners envision how AI can assist them in human-centric reasoning, two AI-based approaches will be illustrated: first, a Naïve Bayes approach for supervised machine-learning of the dataset, which assumes no direct relations between the mixture components; and second, a semi-supervised Bayesian approach to machine-learn the same dataset for possible relations between the mixture components. These AI-based approaches enable controlled experiments to be conducted in-silico, where selected parameters could be held constant, while others could be changed to simulate hypothetical “what-if” scenarios. In applying AI to think discursively, AI-Thinking can be educed from the STEAM learners, thereby improving their AI literacy, which in turn enables them to ask better questions to solve problems. © 2019 by the authors.

Given the broad range of skills and the numerous competencies required to meet the demands of future society, the proposed wider and higher-level framework is based on STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art and design, and mathematics) and addresses the limitations of conventional computational thinking by tackling some of the skills and competencies. This is done by proposing the enrichment of STEAM educational approach with art thinking, which may be defined as a creative human-centred discovery process. To explore such enrichment, we conducted a workshop on art thinking. The motivation of the workshop was to explore whether art thinking can overcome some of the limitations of computational thinking regarding future education in the OECD learning framework. We discuss STEAM as focusing on design creativity competency, and we outline the development of educational activities such as workshops to promote competencies in the perspective of OECD framework. © 2019 Design Society.

"Escape rooms for STEAM education: Comparing design phases","Karageorgiou Z.; Fotaris P.; Mavrommati E.","2020","Proceedings of the European Conference on Games-based Learning","2","Conference paper","EN","The use of Escape rooms in education shows a constantly increasing rate, since schools need to operate with different paradigms of learning. Teachers often incorporate such live action games in their practice either as formative assessment tool or as a method for experiential, peer-group, game-based learning. In vocational schools it's important to encourage and motivate students in order to help them find their professional rehabilitation. This paper addresses the design phases that took place at a vocational school in Greece during the development of two different escape rooms. As part of their Creative Activities Zone (CAZ) classes, 12 STEAM students created a Christmas-themed Escape room for a local council. This project was built upon another escape room developed at the same school the previous year by 39 multi-disciplinary students. In both games, one student took the role of a non-player character (NPC) and interacted with the players throughout the game. This article presents and compares the design stages for the aforementioned action plans in order to assist educators and other stakeholders with incorporating escape rooms into their teaching practice. Designing escape rooms that combine technology, creative writing and drama games, can offer students opportunities to think outside the box, develop problem-solving, decision making, and strategic planning skills, as well as become useful citizens to their local community. © 2020 Dechema e.V..

Data were collected from 238 pre-service teachers in Korea and were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results indicate that pre-service teachers’ art appreciation, attitude toward science, and technology acceptance had a significant effect on their creative convergence competency. In particular, their attitude toward science had the greatest effect on the creative convergence competency, which had a significant effect on the teaching competency in STEAM education. In addition, individual characteristics (i.e., art appreciation, attitude toward science) had indirect effects on the teaching competency in STEAM education mediated by the creative convergence competency. Overall, the results of this study show the criticality of supporting pre-service teachers to develop positive attitudes toward art appreciation and science to foster creative convergence skills. In conclusion, we suggest that the current fragmented approach with strict disciplinary boundaries at teaching education institutions does not adequately prepare pre-service teachers to be competent in teaching STEAM education. More holistic and systemic approaches are necessary to support the trajectory of pre-service teachers’ development of STEAM teaching competency. © 2018, De La Salle University."

"Course design and teaching practice in STEAM education at distance via an interactive e-learning platform: A case study","Chen W.; Tang X.; Mou T.","2019","Asian Association of Open Universities Journal","6","Article","EN","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide some references for teachers who use KidsProgram or other graphic programming tools platform for STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) education at distance by game-based teaching. From the design of the STEAM class, teachers can know how to stimulate students’ interest in programming and cultivating their ability to innovate and solve practical problems more clearly with KidsProgram. Design/methodology/approach: This paper will explain the teaching design from ten aspects and implement it in real class to see the result. The ten aspects are situations creation, knowledge popularization, raising problems, analyzing problems, concepts introduction, interface design, logic design, self-evaluation and mutual evaluation, teacher comments and extension and innovation. With the KidsProgram platform, this paper takes “The Missile Convey,” a sub-course of “Discovery Universe” as an example. Through the situation created by the teacher, students brainstorm the dangers that the earth may encounter in the universe and then learn relevant scientific knowledge. Next, students raise and analyze problems according to the situation under the guidance of the teacher. Through the interaction with teachers, students review the programming concepts and the usage of corresponding coding blocks needed for the project, like “random number.” They need to carry out interface design and logic design for the project, and complete the project. After that, the students use the self-evaluation form and the mutual evaluation form to modify and then show and share the projects to the in front of the class. After self-evaluation and peer evaluation, the teacher will make a final summary evaluation and make some suggestions for improvement. From the students’ programming productions and the interviews with them, the teaching result can be known. Findings: With elaborate teaching design and appropriate teaching strategies, students can flexibly use multi-disciplinary knowledge of science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics to solve problems in the process of creation, which is conducive to the cultivation and improvement of students’ comprehensive quality on KidsProgram classroom, under the guidance of STEAM education. In other words, in this class, students need to use engineering thinking to plan the whole project based on the understanding of scientific principles, design interfaces with artistic ideas, use mathematical knowledge for logical operations, and gradually solve technical problems with the above knowledge or methods in a comprehensive way. Originality/value: The KidsProgram is a leading graphical programming tool platform in China in recent years. It deeply reconstructs the concept of Scratch designed by MIT. Graphic programming, a method of programming by dragging and dropping blocks containing natural languages, is different from traditional code programming. In this paper, the visualized cases in the class will be demonstrated in the “interface design” and “logic design.” This paper designs a course in STEAM education at distance via KidsProgram, hoping to provide some reference for other research on teaching of graphical programming tools. © 2019, Wu Chen, Xin Tang and Ting Mou."

With our summer program, our objective is to serve advanced manufacturing, as evolving technology and to improve STEM education and prepare the new generation of high-school students (future engineers) by the use of the existing tools. Through the use of programs, such as Autodesk Inventor and CREO, as well as 3D printing concepts, we include both technology and basic traditional STEM topics, such as math and science. These tools allow the students to reach their objectives without going through complex mathematics and engineering concepts and methods. This way, these projects will mostly focus on critical thinking and the development of creative solutions to problems. Without deep mathematics knowledge, students were able to conceptualize, customize and prototype their design. The visual nature of these tools (Inventor and CREO) and the 3D printing technology enabled high-school students to grasp the technology and concepts very quickly. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the design and implementation of an experiment, from basic parts. In particular, we will discuss the lesson learned, such as: - Instead of going through the program chapter by chapter, we are encouraging collaboration and integrated work, through a set of projects that students need to select only five of them that fit their need and curiosity. - Going through the design process, step-by-step: define the problem, background research, specify the requirements, brainstorm solutions, development work, prepare the prototype and finally assessment and analysis. Students have the ability to create their own designs using tools to reach creative design and concrete outcomes. Most importantly, the project methodology will be discussed. We discuss the project design program from students' point of view, and the experience earned in design, integration, and also in written and oral communication skills. The methodology used to evaluate the effectiveness of this design program in term of learning outcomes is also described.

The participants were 104 teachers from five campuses of the university that offers STEM undergraduate programs. A quantitative research design was employed to address the central theme: The identification of the gap between the beliefs and perceptions of STEM Educators regarding the role of research in university teaching. T-test was used to test the difference between the actual and ideal beliefs of teachers. Cohen’s d values were computed to determine the effect sizes. The present study revealed that the STEM teachers highly valued the role of research in teaching. They especially considered the development of creative and critical dispositions as the most important goals of integrating research into teaching. However, the teachers reported low actual integration of research into their current teaching, revealing a major gap between their beliefs and the perceived actual integration research into their own teaching practices as evident in the result of the statistical tests. It further showed that institutional background appeared to be critical in the integration of research in teaching. Ultimately, STEM education in the university is emphatic on research content in the delivery of instruction while creating opportunities for learners to participate along the learning process. However, a research-based approach remains to be unpopular, much less for a research-oriented classroom. Strengthening research support and widening the scope of research culture are recommended. © 2020, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved."

In which, the CDIO framework, standards and syllabus are embedded and aligned with the STEAM program in two aspects: in most of the stages of the continuous improvement process of program development and implementation, and in lesson syllabus structure. The research concludes with implications for educational researchers and educators to consider that it is very potential to apply CDIO principles for an integrated curriculum with a project-based method for STEAM education, especially with the CDIO-based STEAM syllabus. The initial satisfaction survey which was taken on more than a hundred students has been carried out and obtained a high score of satisfaction, revealing the suitability in both curriculum and teaching-learning activity design. The CDIO-based maker space reflects its superior advantages of supporting innovative learning environments. Therefore, good practices on CDIO implementation are recommended for further discussion by the STEAM community. © 2020 CDIO. All Rights Reserved."

"Generating Game Levels to Develop Computer Science Competencies in Game-Based Learning Environments","Park K.; Mott B.; Min W.; Wiebe E.; Boyer K.E.; Lester J.","2020","Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","5","Conference paper","EN","Game-based learning environments hold significant potential for supporting K-12 computer science (CS) education by providing CS learning experiences embedded within engaging virtual worlds. However, many game-based learning environments do not adaptively support individual students based on their specific knowledge and skills. Often, this is because creating game levels is highly labor-intensive, which limits the number of levels created to support student learning. Procedural content generation (PCG) is a promising direction for addressing this challenge by dynamically creating game levels that address specific student needs without requiring extensive development effort. In this paper, we investigate a PCG framework driven by answer set programming (ASP), a variant of logic programming that utilizes well-formed logical rules to express constraints for valid game levels. We demonstrate how variations in CS learning objectives and game-playing skills can be incorporated into ASP-based rules to generate learner-adaptive levels in a middle-grades CS game-based learning environment. Evaluations of the generated levels suggest that the ASP-based level generator not only reliably generates desired CS educational game levels but also synthesizes a large set of diverse game levels. The findings suggest that the ASP-based PCG approach has considerable promise for creating highly engaging and adaptive game-based learning experiences for K-12 CS education. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

"Work in progress: Transformation through liberal arts-focused grand challenges scholars programs","Wood A.; Arslan S.; Barrett J.; Brownell S.A.; Herbert A.M.; Marshall M.; Oates K.K.; Spanagel D.; Winebrake J.J.; Zastavker Y.V.","2019","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings","2","Conference paper","EN","The National Academy of Engineering's Grand Challenges Scholars Program (GCSP) was created to better prepare students to tackle the immense and immensely complex challenges of the twenty-first century. The program does this by providing education and experiences in five competency areas: talent, multidisciplinary, viable business/entrepreneurship, multicultural, and social consciousness. These competencies align well with education and experiences often acquired under the umbrella of the liberal arts. This alignment, along with the rising tide of evidence that integration of liberal arts with STEM is beneficial for students' education, led representatives from four colleges - Olin College of Engineering, Lawrence Technological University, Rochester Institute of Technology, and Worcester Polytechnic Institute - to undertake a collaborative project, supported with funding from the Teagle Foundation, to explore GCSP as a vehicle for integrating liberal arts with STEM education (primarily engineering) and addressing the NAE's five competencies. GCSP inherently engages students beyond narrow disciplinary boundaries and encourages students to see the limits of single-method approaches to technological problem solving. The program creates opportunities for engineering (and non-engineering) students from diverse fields to engage with the social and humanistic dimensions of the Grand Challenges. When additional emphasis is placed on deep integration of liberal arts with engineering disciplines, GCSP even more effectively roots students in paradigms, epistemologies, and methodologies that they would otherwise not encounter during an engineering undergraduate degree. As discussed in a 2018 National Academies' report, developing conceptual frameworks “may enable [non-experts] to learn content more readily because they can then better understand the relevance of that information and its connections with otherwise seemingly disparate facts;” that is, the development of new conceptual frameworks, derived from a variety of disciplines, can help students better understand and synthesize a broader range of information. Gaining experience in these new ways of thinking and doing qualitatively changes the way in which students approach both learning and practice. New modes of thought and increased integration of learning and ideas also help students connect their interior, personal development with the “grand challenges” they study in GCSP, leading them to identify roles for themselves in tackling these complex problems; this identification lends itself to agency development and increased motivation. Thus we suggest that participation in a “liberal arts-infused GCSP” transforms a student's learning experience through not only acquisition of new information but also new ways of thinking, knowing, doing, and being. As this approach to GCSP provides transformational experiences for students, the creation of these programs has also led to transformations at the levels of the participating institutions. With implementation of GCSP now in different stages at our four schools, all are finding evidence of transformations occurring at the student, institute, and community level. We illustrate these transformations in this paper and suggest that they were driven by development of liberal arts-infused GCSPs. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019."
"FULL STEAM AHEAD: HANDS-ON ELEMENTARY EDUCATION and PERSISTENCE during COVID-19","Das M.","2020","ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition, Proceedings (IMECE)","1","Conference paper","EN","It is well recognized that the world needs to develop interdisciplinary problem solvers and creative thinkers to address the problems of the future. Training in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math (STEAM) is essential for understanding the complexity of the world around us and for identifying and tackling critical technical and social issues. To that end, many programs have been launched all around the world to expose students to STEAM fields and to encourage them to pursue STEAM careers. Hands-on, projectbased learning has been shown to get more students engaged with STEAM and help them learn key skills for the future. However, most STEAM education programs target students in upper-middle or high school. If students are nurtured at earlier ages to love thinking critically, solving problems, and building, they are more likely to pursue STEAM fields. This paper describes the implementation of project-based STEAM curriculum with elementary school students from ages 6-13. It includes a detailed discussion of curriculum design, case studies of specific student work, subjective analysis of engagement level with various projects, and discussion of lessons learned. The paper also discusses how the makerspace environment where the students execute their projects has been set up to be accessible for students in this age range. Additionally, the paper describes how a hands-on STEAM curriculum that traditionally relies on in-person feedback, materials, and access to peers as teammates can be maintained while having students learning remotely. Educational techniques for hands-on learning while physical distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed. © 2020 ASME."
"Escape rooms for STEAM education: Comparing design phases","Karageorgiou Z.; Fotaris P.; Mavrommati E.","2020","Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Game Based Learning, ECGBL 2020","1","Conference paper","EN","The use of Escape rooms in education shows a constantly increasing rate, since schools need to operate with different paradigms of learning. Teachers often incorporate such live action games in their practice either as formative assessment tool or as a method for experiential, peer-group, game-based learning. In vocational schools it's important to encourage and motivate students in order to help them find their professional rehabilitation. This paper addresses the design phases that took place at a vocational school in Greece during the development of two different escape rooms. As part of their Creative Activities Zone (CAZ) classes, 12 STEAM students created a Christmas-themed Escape room for a local council. This project was built upon another escape room developed at the same school the previous year by 39 multi-disciplinary students. In both games, one student took the role of a non-player character (NPC) and interacted with the players throughout the game. This article presents and compares the design stages for the aforementioned action plans in order to assist educators and other stakeholders with incorporating escape rooms into their teaching practice. Designing escape rooms that combine technology, creative writing and drama games, can offer students opportunities to think outside the box, develop problem-solving, decision making, and strategic planning skills, as well as become useful citizens to their local community. © ECGBL 2020.All right reserved."
"Enabling creative collaboration for all levels of learning","Kim Y.E.; Morton B.G.; Gregorio J.; Rosen D.S.; Edouard K.; Vallett R.","2019","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","15","Article","EN","A potential path for enabling greater creativity and collaboration is through increased arts and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) integration in education and research. This approach has been a growing discussion in US national forums and is the foundation of the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics plus arts and design (STEAM) education movement. Developing authentic artistic integrations with STEM fields (or vice versa) is challenging, particularly in higher education, where traditional disciplinary structures and incentives can impede the creation of integrated programs. Measuring and assessing the outcomes of such integration efforts can be even more challenging, since traditional metrics do not necessarily capture new opportunities created for students and faculty, and the greatest impact may occur over a long period (a career). At Drexel University, we created the Expressive & Creative Interaction Technologies (ExCITe) Center as a standalone institute to pursue and enable such transdisciplinary arts-STEM collaborations, particularly with external arts and education partners. In this perspectives paper, we highlight a range of projects and outcomes resulting from such external collaborations, including graduate research with professional artists, undergraduate student work experiences, and STEAM-based education programs for kindergarten through 12th-grade (K-12) students. While each project has its own specific objectives and outcomes, we believe that they collectively demonstrate this integrated transdisciplinary approach to be impactful and potentially transformative for all levels of learning. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

"The impact of teaching the subject “pressure” with STEM approach on the academic achievements of the secondary school 7th grade students and their attitudes towards STEM","Özcan H.; Koca E.","2019","Egitim ve Bilim","12","Article","EN","                             The objective of this study is to determine the effect of a teaching module on the topic of pressure, developed with STEM approach, on the academic achievements of the students as well as on their attitudes towards STEM. The study employed the explanatory sequential design, as one of mixed method research designs. On the quantitative aspect of the study, a pre-test and post-test control group, quasi-experimental design was used, while phenomenological design was utilized for qualitative aspects. The sample group of the research comprises of 33 7                             th                              grade students studying in a village school located in a district of one of the metropolitan municipalities in Turkey for the Spring Semester of the 2017-2018 school year. A STEM education approach was used in the experimental group for teaching the subject of “Pressure” while utilizing the approach as stipulated in the curriculum for the control group. An academic achievement test, an attitude scale for STEM, semi-structured interviews, and the student diaries are the data collection tools used in the study. A significant difference was found between the experimental group and the control group, with the former showing increased academic achievement over the latter in the research. A significant difference was also found between the experimental group and the control group, with the former showing more positive attitudes towards STEM than were shown by the latter. The opinions of the students on STEM education were analyzed in order to study the results obtained from quantitative data. Five themes – feelings and opinions, positive aspects, skills gained, features and problems faced, and the learning process were obtained—as well as 26 codes—with the content analysis of semi-structured interviews and students’ diaries. It was concluded that involving STEM-based implementations in teaching the subject “Pressure” increased the academic success rate and attitude scores of students while helping the students to develop positive perceptions of STEM education. In future studies, certain influences of STEM education implementations, such as self-confidence of students, the ability to present creative solutions, communication skills, for example, may be studied.                          © 2019 Turkish Education Association.

"On a making-&-tinkering approach to learning mathematics in formal education: Knowledge gains, attitudes, and 21st-century skills","Timotheou S.; Ioannou A.","2019","Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning Conference, CSCL","4","Conference paper","EN","Making and tinkering, as learning practices, have gained a lot of attention during the last decade, especially in STEAM education. Despite the significant interest in making-&- tinkering activities, most of the research has focused on implementations in non-formal and informal educational settings, with learners of older age (i.e., students in secondary school). The present study sought to investigate young students’ knowledge gains, attitudes towards a making-&-tinkering approach to learning mathematics in formal education and the development of 21st-century skills as they engaged in a collaborative making-&-tinkering project using a variety of arts, crafts, and technological tools such as a physical robot. The making-&-tinkering approach involved making, tinkering, programming, and play in a group project integrated into the formal mathematics curriculum. Findings from the study suggest that young students can greatly benefit from such an approach. The study has demonstrated the applicability and value of such methods for young learners in formal educational contexts, with implications for future research and practice in the field. © ISLS."
"Increasing Parental Involvement in Computer Science Education Through the Design and Development of Family Creative Computing Workshops","Bresnihan N.; Strong G.; Fisher L.; Millwood R.; Lynch Á.","2020","Communications in Computer and Information Science","4","Conference paper","EN","The importance of parental involvement (PI) in education is well established. However, the growth of CS Education at K12 level in recent years has raised questions about parents’ confidence and competence in engaging in this area with their children because of their own lack of CS knowledge and skills. This paper outlines the development and evaluation of family workshops designed to increase parental confidence and competence in partaking of CS activities with their primary-school aged children (5–13). A number of design principles were identified through a comprehensive needs analysis leading to the development of a model for family creative-computing workshops. The evaluation aimed primarily to investigate the effect of the strategy on the participants’ confidence in partaking in creative computing activities with their families. Positive results were found for the sample investigated in whom the mean confidence level rose significantly. Participants reported satisfaction with and enjoyment of the strategy, particularly the inter-family collaboration and the creation of concrete artefacts. Confidence in their ability to organise such activities also rose significantly and a number of the participating families went on to do so. The identification and evaluation of the design principles for family CS activities as well as the workshop model should be of interest to other researchers and practitioners interested in improving PI in CS Education. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

"Gamification in STEM programming courses: State of the art","Venter M.","2020","IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON","40","Conference paper","EN","Computer programming courses are an essential facet of STEM education, confronted by many pressing challenges. Higher education (HE) students struggle to master programming principles resulting in unsatisfactory pass rates, student retention and low levels of student engagement. Gamification in programming courses has been recognized as a prospective technique that could improve student participation as well as impact learning in a positive way. There is currently a shortage of review studies published in the last two years (2018-2019) that focus specifically on the gamification of programming courses in HE. The aim of this paper is to bridge this gap and to provide a comprehensive review of literature concerning studies that focused on the usage of gamification systems in the teaching of programming courses in HE from 2014 until 2019. Results indicate that the most popular gamification elements that were used in the reviewed studies were leaderboards, followed by points, badges and levels. Additionally, in terms of the tools or instruments that were used to implement gamification solutions, it was discovered that the development of a new gamification platform and the usage of existing gamification tools were the most wide-spread method for gamification implementation. Lastly, from the studies that were reviewed, it was evident that gamification of HE programming courses had a very positive impact on student engagement, student programming knowledge and student motivation. This review paper fills a void in existing literature and could therefore serve as a valuable resource for academe that consider gamifying HE programming courses. © 2020 IEEE."

"Shaping Preservice Teachers’ Understandings of STEM: A Collaborative Math and Science Methods Approach","Bartels S.L.; Rupe K.M.; Lederman J.S.","2019","Journal of Science Teacher Education","40","Article","EN","Science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education has become an international focus of science education curricular reforms. However, few K–12 teachers have the background to authentically teach STEM in an integrated way. This is especially true of elementary teachers, who are often less confident or prepared to teach STEM disciplines independently. Most methods courses for preservice elementary teachers are taught independently by content area (math, science, language arts, and social studies), and seldom model integrated teaching strategies. Preservice teachers should have opportunities to experience and create developmentally appropriate curricula that integrate STEM disciplines. This study sought to bridge elementary preservice math and science methods courses through the modeling of integrated STEM lessons. The researchers who served as course instructors codesigned a STEM unit and collaborated throughout the semester. After explicit modeling and practice, surveys and lesson plans were used to determine the preservice elementary teachers’ understandings of STEM and their ability to plan integrated STEM lessons. In both the science and mathematics methods courses, the month-long unit on STEM education included explicitly modeled STEM lessons and culminated with preservice teachers planning, teaching, and reflecting on their own integrated lessons. Although misconceptions that a STEM lesson needed to address every discipline remained, the teachers’ ability to recognize and design lessons improved. This study supports the value of collaboratively taught elementary math and science methods courses to provide the experiences teachers will need to deliver STEM instruction in their classrooms. © 2019, © 2019 Association for Science Teacher Education."

"Applying Computer Science in Biology: A Model for Incorporating Interdisciplinary Pedagogical Approaches through ePortfolio in the First Year Experience at LaGuardia Community College","Xu N.; Keller C.; Ye Y.","2019","2019 9th IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference, ISEC 2019","1","Conference paper","EN","This paper describes the use of ePortfolio as a platform for an interdisciplinary, collaborative course project for First Year Seminar (FYS) students in an Engineering and Computer Science FYS class, and in a Liberal Arts: Math and Science FYS class. This project was designed to enrich the integrative research experience of new-to-college students at LaGuardia Community College, and to engage them in hands-on inquiry and problem-solving practice, with a broader goal of increasing the retention rate in STEM majors by introducing students to the interdisciplinary nature of modern science and encouraging them to think of their future career paths in the same context. The major task in the project was to compare RNA sequences using computer programs, in order to facilitate the study of blood cancer. Throughout the project, students in both classes applied mathematical skills to perform algorithm analysis on a biological problem and were exposed to the application and basis of relevant technology in Computer Science. Collaborative work was conducted using ePortfolio as an online course platform which hosted all student work and allowed remote communication and collaboration to happen between two classes in different majors. Based on survey feedback, students were impressed by how they could contribute to the task using basic math and computer skills, and interest in continuing their STEM education was expressed unanimously. © 2019 IEEE."
"Linguistic and cultural rights in steam education: Science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics","Babaci-Wilhite Z.","2020","The Palgrave Handbook of African Education and Indigenous Knowledge","0","Book chapter","EN","The premise for this chapter is that the integration of African languages into the teaching of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) subjects is an imperative and will make education more accessible and creative at all levels. This chapter provides tools and strategies for organizing and managing interdisciplinary learning and teaching based on successful collaborations between applied linguists, human rights advocates, STEM researchers, practitioners, and artists in the fields of Arts and STEM subjects, which creates the acronym STEAM. Through a literature review and collaborative works, this chapter will address how the learning of STEM can be improved through acknowledgment of local languages and cultural context by inserting an “A” for Arts in STEM. This will be demonstrated with cases from Africa with a focus on Tanzania, Nigeria, and Malawi. Based on contributions from educators, scientists, scholars, linguists, and artists from these countries and around the world, this chapter will highlight how we can demonstrate teamwork and collaboration for innovation and creativity in the field of STEAM subjects in classrooms and beyond. Drawing language and cultural perspectives into educational models can make Science and Mathematics learning more accessible. For example, recognizing the cultural and historical evidence on the relevance of ethno-mathematical principles is important in establishing an egalitarian connection to STEAM subjects. This can best be accomplished through a model, which accommodates language and Arts as means to demystify Science and Mathematics and to bridge the separation of Mathematics from the contexts of everyday experience. Education should be viewed as the Art of dealing with cultural encounters. This chapter reflects on the core of human rights education using local languages and local knowledge through the Arts as a tool for teaching human rights in school, bringing to light questions on diversity, environmental issues, as well as power relations between non-dominant (minority) and dominant (majority) segments of the society based on a renewed pedagogy. This chapter will be based on cutting-edge research and elaborates on how to approach novel methodologies in the production of curriculum for Linguistic and Cultural Rights through STEAM education. I conclude that for better learning in the twenty-first-century literacies, implementing local languages and local knowledge in education, integrating approaches from the Arts, will improve the learning and teaching of STEM subjects. STEAM should be given the status of a right in education for multilingual, multicultural, and sustainable development in Africa. © The Author(s) 2020."
"Moving Toward Transdisciplinary Instruction: A Longitudinal Examination of STEAM Teaching Practices","Quigley C.F.; Herro D.; Baker A.","2019","STEAM Education: Theory and Practice","21","Book chapter","EN","For years, the STEAM movement has been touted by businesses, universities, and even governments as a way to move beyond focusing on single disciplines such as science but instead toward multiple modes of problem-solving and viewpoints (Connor AM, Karmokar S, Whittington C. International Journal of Engineering Pedagog 5(2):37–47, 2015). However, STEAM education in the K-12 setting is still relatively new, which has led to a limited conceptual understanding of how to conceptualize, design, or enact STEAM education (Kim & Park, The effect of STEAM education on elementary school student’s creativity improvement. In Kim T, Stoica A, Fang W, Vasilakos T, Villalba J, Arnett K,… Kang B (eds), Computer applications for security, control and system engineering. Springer, Berlin/Heidelberg, pp 115–121. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-35264-5_16, 2012). This limited understanding often leads teachers to use existing STEM models and attempt to “add-on” experiences with the arts or humanities (Henriksen D, DeSchryver M, Mishra P, Deep-Play Research Group, TechTrends 59:5, 2015). In response, the authors have spent the last 3 years conducting a longitudinal study exploring how STEAM teaching practices are enacted in a variety of settings in the southeast of the United States in order to understand teachers’ implementation strategies (Herro D, Quigley C, Prof Dev Educ, 1–23, 2016a, On the Horizon 24:190–204, 2016b; Quigley C, Herro D, J Sci Educ Technol 25:410–426, 2016; Quigley, Herro, & Jamil. 2017). Based on a qualitative study examining classroom observations, teachers’ reflective journals during STEAM implementation, and focus-group teacher interviews, this chapter will highlight vignettes of these classrooms including elementary and secondary school examples as well as discipline-focused STEAM examples. The goal of this chapter is to inform teacher educators and provide support to teachers who are attempting to implement this transdisciplinary approach to learning. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019."

"Improving the Scalability and Replicability of Embedded Systems Remote Laboratories through a Cost-Effective Architecture","Villar-Martinez A.; Rodriguez-Gil L.; Angulo I.; Orduna P.; Garcia-Zubia J.; Lopez-De-Ipina D.","2019","IEEE Access","38","Article","EN","Online remote laboratories are a particularly promising tool for effective STEM education. They offer online universal access to different hardware devices in which students can experiment and can test and improve their knowledge. However, most of them have two significant limitations. First, given that most of them are developed as, or evolve from single-user proofs of concept, they have no scalability provisions other than full laboratory replication. And second, when this is done, cost efficiency is often neglected. This paper presents the requirements for the creation of a novel remote laboratory architecture focused on, but not limited to, embedded systems experimentation. An architecture, based on Redis (an open source, in-memory data structure store, which is often used as database, cache or message broker), a modular design, and hardware-sharing techniques, is proposed in order to achieve the combined requirements of high scalability and cost efficiency. This mixed hardware-software architecture serves as a basis for the development of remote laboratories, especially those focused on microcontroller-based systems experimentation and embedded devices experimentation. From a user perspective the architecture is web-based, and has provisions to be easily adaptable to different Learning Management Systems and different hardware embedded devices. A new microcontroller-oriented remote laboratory based on the architecture has been developed, with the aim of providing valid evaluation data, and has been used in a real environment. The architecture and the resulting remote laboratory have been compared with other state of the art remote laboratories and their architectures. Results suggest that the proposed architecture does indeed meet the main requirements, which are scalability through replicability and cost efficiency. Furthermore, similarly to previous architectures, it promotes usability, universal access, modularity and reliability. © 2013 IEEE."

The arts (A) in STEAM is to improve student learning, creativity development, and potential for success. Therefore, many experts have argued about the relationship between science and art. In this view, art education is very important in developing high-value creativity in modern education. Although STEAM education has been applying in Vietnam for several years, however, lack of research mentioned about students and teachers' perspective of the roles of Arts in STEAM education and what challenges high schools facing in the real context. This study tried to fill this gap. A mix-method study was employed, 240 students and 52 teachers from 5 high schools selected by random technique were involved for data collection. SPSS software was used in data management and analysis. The finding showed that, most of teacher and students advocated of the important of Arts in STEAM and schools should use the term of STEAM replaced of STEM.

For example, in the United States, a new, nationally-administered computer science exam is evaluating students' understanding of programming concepts using both block-based and text-based presentations of short programs written in a custom pseudocode. The presence of the block-based modality on a written exam in an unimplemented pseudocode is a far cry from the informal, creative, and live coding contexts where block-based programming initially gained popularity. Further, the design of the block-based pseudocode used on the exam includes few of the features cited in the research as contributing to positive learner experiences. In this paper, we seek to understand the implications of the inclusion of an unimplemented block-based pseudocode on a written exam. To do so, we analyze responses from over 5,000 students to a 20 item assessment that included both block-based and text-based questions written in the same pseudocode as the national exam. Our analysis shows students performing better on questions presented in the block-based form compared to text-based questions. Further analysis shows that this difference is consistent across conceptual categories. This paper contributes to our understanding of the affordances of block-based programming and if and how the modality can help learners succeed in early computer science learning experiences. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

The project, started in 2018 January, will be closed in 2019 December; the activities are already in progress and the present work intends to communicate the methodological approach that has been adopted by the project Consortium. The strategy, elaborated by the IT, Turkey and EN partners to reinforce learning skills, is based on Smart City projecting actions by the development of a didactic mini-game with challenges based on the scientific concepts acquired. DIGITgame proposes a new approach to communicate and teach traditional topics of environmental sciences using the new thematic of Smart Cities and taking advantage introducing the videogame solution. The strength to involve actively students and teachers is a double ""use"" of the concept of education entertainment: to project a game is an unusual amazing didactic activity (entertainment) who's final result is a game designed to support STEM education in an entertainment perspective. This didactic strategy will permit to reinforce the achievement of advanced and high quality competences, both in scientific topics and digital knowledge. It is the way to reinforce the consciousness on sustainable and smart cities policy and management in the citizen of the future. The mini-game is organized around a set of ""basic variables"" (climate, industrialization, green level, green transports) that design the virtual city contest, the students challenge is to project and build the ""assets"" (urban trees, urban climate detection by weather station positioning, green transports, solar panel and recycle stations distribution, smart building) from a dared point of view, balancing costs, scores, constrains and final goal. Each asset represents a subject of the official national school's curriculum in IT and TK and it will be the subject of in-room lessons and seminars. The match between traditional approach, gamification challenge and informatics is the keystone to turn young students in involved and aware citizens.

Through a systematic literature review, a framework will be proposed based on the key problems that novice learners experience. In this proposed framework, a sequence of activities has been developed to facilitate understanding of the requirements, solutions and incremental modelling. An example is provided illustrating how the framework could be used to incorporate visualization and gaming elements into a Systems Analysis classroom; therefore, improving motivation and learning.

"Facilitating an Elementary Engineering Design Process Module","Hill-Cunningham P.R.; Mott M.S.; Hunt A.-B.","2018","School Science and Mathematics","13","Article","EN","STEM education in elementary school is guided by the understanding that engineering represents the application of science and math concepts to make life better for people. The Engineering Design Process (EDP) guides the application of creative solutions to problems. Helping teachers understand how to apply the EDP to create lessons develops a classroom where students are engaged in solving real world problems by applying the concepts they learn about science and mathematics. This article outlines a framework for developing such lessons and units, and discusses the underlying theory of systems thinking. A model lesson that uses this framework is discussed. Misconceptions regarding the EDP that children have displayed through this lesson and other design challenge lessons are highlighted. Through understanding these misconceptions, teachers can do a better job of helping students understand the system of ideas that helps engineers attack problems in the real world. Getting children ready for the 21st century requires a different outlook. Children need to tackle problems with a plan and not shrivel when at first, they fail. Seeing themselves as engineers will help more underrepresented students see engineering and other STEM fields as viable career options, which is our ultimate goal. © 2018 School Science and Mathematics Association."

"How have robots supported STEM teaching?","Benitti F.B.V.; Spolaôr N.","2017","Robotics in STEM Education: Redesigning the Learning Experience","57","Book chapter","EN","Context: Robotics has assisted teachers to combine technology and engineering topics to concretize science and mathematics concepts in real-world applications. As a result, benefits in different concepts and skills, as well as positive long-term effects, have been observed. Objective: This work aims to identify stateof- the-art robotics applications to support STEM teaching. To do so, we intend to answer six research questions: (1) What concepts are considered and how are they explored? (2) What skills are expected to be developed? (3) How is educational robotics associated with school curriculum? (4) What types of robots are used? (5) What age groups/educational levels are considered? (6) How is educational robotics evaluated? Method: We carried out a systematic literature review to identify, assess, and synthesize relevant papers published from 2013. A protocol developed by us guided the review conduction and enhanced its repeatability with reduced subjectivity. Results: 60 publications able to answer the research questions were summarized. We found that: (1) several STEM concepts have been explored in all educational levels; (2) educational robotics is still frequently associated with teamwork and problem-solving development, extracurricular activities, and LEGO robots; (3) only 25% of the 60 papers quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated learning. Conclusion: Robots support for STEM education has been successful in different scenarios. The inherent flexibility, coupled with the experiences reported by a significant piece of the literature, can inspire new applications of educational robotics. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

Yet no currently available programming tools exist that have been specifically created to enable youth to create such systems. Similarly, industrial and academic programming practices often involve the simultaneous production and subsequent integration of code by multiple collaborators. But few youth-focused programming tools have been designed to support this form of authentic participation in computing. We describe the design of a new programming environment that addresses both of these needs. It empowers adolescents to design, make, and program interactive, tangible networked technologies, indicating the feasibility of networked technology as a design and programming genre for youth. We show how distributed programming tools can offer young people agency to work within a variety of collaboration structures. We present results from two U.S. middle school classroom implementations. Students created a wide variety of projects that included interaction design, physical artifact design and making, and network programming. Students enacted a variety of collaboration approaches that were responsive to their creative goals and inter-personal relationships. They programmed a system of small single-board computers that process input and output information from connected sensors, actuators, or synthesizers, and communicate over a network. Students constructed different collaborative structures, from pair to jigsaw programming.

"Grounded and embodied mathematical cognition: Promoting mathematical insight and proof using action and language","Nathan M.J.; Walkington C.","2017","Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications","90","Article","EN","We develop a theory of grounded and embodied mathematical cognition (GEMC) that draws on action-cognition transduction for advancing understanding of how the body can support mathematical reasoning. GEMC proposes that participants’ actions serve as inputs capable of driving the cognition-action system toward associated cognitive states. This occurs through a process of transduction that promotes valuable mathematical insights by eliciting dynamic depictive gestures that enact spatio-temporal properties of mathematical entities. Our focus here is on pre-college geometry proof production. GEMC suggests that action alone can foster insight but is insufficient for valid proof production if action is not coordinated with language systems for propositionalizing general properties of objects and space. GEMC guides the design of a video game-based learning environment intended to promote students’ mathematical insights and informal proofs by eliciting dynamic gestures through in-game directed actions. GEMC generates several hypotheses that contribute to theories of embodied cognition and to the design of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education interventions. Pilot study results with a prototype video game tentatively support theory-based predictions regarding the role of dynamic gestures for fostering insight and proof-with-insight, and for the role of action coupled with language to promote proof-with-insight. But the pilot yields mixed results for deriving in-game interventions intended to elicit dynamic gesture production. Although our central purpose is an explication of GEMC theory and the role of action-cognition transduction, the theory-based video game design reveals the potential of GEMC to improve STEM education, and highlights the complex challenges of connecting embodiment research to education practices and learning environment design. © 2017, The Author(s)."

Improving student engagement leads to an increase in learning motivation, ultimately enhancing students' ability to grasp complex topic areas. A common strategy to achieve higher engagement levels in the classroom is game-based learning (GBL). GBL has received mixed reviews due to a lack of data comparison and the difficulty of balancing entertainment with educational value. The objective of this study was to investigate how student knowledge transfer compares between a GBL activity and a traditional classroom lecture within STEM education. The GBL activity developed for the study was a cooperative board game called Preservation. During the game, players worked together to mitigate a tide of environmental threats related to the corn-water-ethanol-beef system in the Midwest. The primary learning outcomes measured during the study were student attitudes towards the environment and their capacity for systems thinking. Students in two junior level undergraduate courses completed pre-post-surveys after experiencing one of three treatments: group one - played Preservation, and group two - played Preservation with supporting lecture. Assessment focused on changes in student attitudes and overall understanding of system interactions. Initial findings suggest that the combination treatment provided the greatest change in systems thinking, however, no change occurred with respect to environmental attitudes. The results of this study will be used to direct the development of subsequent games and hands-on activities to promote transformational learning strategies in STEM education. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018."
"Training computational thinking: Game-based unplugged and plugged-in activities in primary school","Tsarava K.; Moeller K.; Pinkwart N.; Butz M.; Trautwein U.; Ninaus M.","2017","Proceedings of the 11th European Conference on Games Based Learning, ECGBL 2017","53","Conference paper","EN","Computational thinking (CT) denotes the idea of developing a generic solution to a problem by decomposing it, identifying relevant variables and patterns, and deriving an algorithmic solution procedure. As a general problem solving strategy, it has been suggested a fundamental cognitive competence to be acquired in education - comparable to literacy and numeracy. However, integrating CT into general curricula has been challenging. Therefore, the current project aims at developing an extra-curricular training of CT for primary school students. From a literature review we identified seven concepts central to CT: i) sequencing, ii) loops, iii) parallelism, iv) events, v) conditionals, vi) operators, and vii) data/variables. In our targeted educational training program, we will specifically address these concepts (which are shared concepts between CT and programming / computer science education) in 2-step procedures using corresponding game-based unplugged and plugged-in activities. Playful unplugged activities, such as a treasure hunt board game for the concept of using variables as placeholders for information, shall allow students getting a first grip on CT processes by actively engaging them. In the game, a treasure is to be hunted by completing a series of arithmetic operations, in which players have to handle different variables (e.g., dice faces, scores, etc.). Building on this unplugged activity, a related plugged-in scenario is a programmable simulation of rain drops filling a glass. While raindrop and glass volume are constants, the fill level of the glass may be the variable to manipulate. In both kinds of activities we aim at clarifying the association between CT-based solving real-life problems and aspects of different STEM disciplines. The series of unplugged and plugged-in activities are integrated into a gamified approach suitable for primary school children, employing badges for mastering specific CT processes to increase students' engagement and for giving feedback about their learning progress. The instructional design will integrate principles of constructionism, game-based and project-based learning, such that students will construct knowledge through playing and interacting with interdisciplinary educational scenarios. The course will be empirically evaluated with 3rd and 4th graders in primary schools. Thereby, the idea of evidence-based instruction is pursued to ensure efficiency and validity of our training."
"STEAM education: Creativity in teacher education programs","Wade-Leeuwen B.","2018","Dimensions and Emerging Themes in Teaching Practicum: A Global Perspective","1","Book chapter","EN","There is an assumption that we are all creative. However, as Sir Ken Robinson (2006) points out: ‘We have been educated out of our creativity!' If schools kill children’s creativity, then how will they reach their full potential? This research outlines the benefits and challenges experienced by Australian primary pre-service teachers while employing a sustainable innovative STEAM model approach that has the potential to enrich their understanding of 21st-century critical and creative skills and the reflective process. STEAM education is an interdisciplinary global approach to learning that incorporates Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics through inquiry-based learning, dialogue and critical understanding. STEAM education works best when art and design are at the heart of learning. Through the arts, learners find new ways to interpret and communicate ideas in traditional, current and emerging forms using digital technologies to help them make better sense of their world. This research demonstrates how these primary pre-service teachers develop their own creative capacities and investigates strategies for collaborative learning through lived experiences so that they can reclaim their own sense of creativity. The findings of the study indicate that pre-service teachers feel more effective practitioners when they are allowed time and space to develop their own creativity and expressive practices. The author argues a need for critical and creative thinking methods to be explicitly taught during teacher education programs in Australia and suggests a variety of multimodal literacies could be applied equally to all assessment practices during their programs. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Melek Çakmak and Müge Gündüz; individual chapters, the contributors."

Despite all efforts, students still show poor performance with course assessments, which can then lead to dropping out of their studies after their first experience with programming. In the last few years, a number of interventions were suggested, including the utilization of educational games that can motivate, stimulate and engage students far better than conventional approaches. In this paper, we present CodeAdventure, an educational adventure-like game that has been designed for learning and practicing introductory programming concepts. CodeAdventure adopts an integrated design approach that employs various mechanisms and techniques to achieve a truly immersive game learning experience while in parallel provides a fun way to practice and apply various programming concepts. CodeAdventure uses compelling graphics and incorporates different learning techniques that have been shown to be effective for students’ learning, such as providing hints and clues on how to solve puzzles, referencing instructional material, and immediate feedback on students’ performance. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017."
"Technology teacher trainees’ lesson planning approach in South Africa: Room for improvement","Kola M.I.","2017","African Journal of Research in Mathematics, Science and Technology Education","4","Article","EN","Technology education in South Africa provides learners with the opportunity to, inter alia, solve problems by applying creative skills using authentic contexts that are embedded in real-life situations. Effective lesson planning is rather imperative in exploiting this opportunity. The design process is considered to be the backbone of teaching technology and should be organised in such a way that all technology aims are achieved. This study, guided by John’s framework for the lesson planning process, followed a qualitative approach to obtain a deeper understanding of the process that teacher trainees undertake while preparing their lesson plans during their teaching practice. Data was collected through openended questions, as well as the lesson plans that the teacher trainees developed during their teaching practice. The findings show that the teacher trainees battled to incorporate the design process when planning their lessons. In addition, they selected teaching methods that barely stimulate cognitive skills. The implications of the findings are worth considering by technology education lecturers as emphasis should be placed on the pedagogical content knowledge of technology. Amongst others, teacher trainees should grasp the content knowledge, a range of teaching strategies relevant to technology and the nature of technology. © 2017 Southern African Association for Research in Mathematics, Science and Technology Education (SAARMSTE)."

Based on the experiences of the authors during the course of a 3-year European Union (EU) funded project, it seeks to outline the benefits and challenges that arise from working in a diverse group of twelve partners drawn from academic, corporate and non-profit sectors, located across nine countries. The chapter presents the aims and outcomes of the Practice-based Experiential Learning Analytics Research and Support (PELARS) project, along with a brief outline of the funding context and attendant structural and organisational frameworks. It conveys a realistic view of both the opportunities and obstacles encountered during a project of this nature and relays useful information about establishing and maintaining effective working relationships between project partners from different disciplines, each with their own area-specific approaches and methodologies. The authors note that the topics discussed relate to their experience only and are not intended to be read as an exhaustive ‘how to’ checklist when approaching transdisciplinary research in STEAM projects or applications, but rather as a guide to highlight some of the potential issues that can be encountered on the journey and methods to address these. Our contribution operates at the edge of two main strands in this publication. On one hand it presents a research project that aims to contribute to STEAM education through technological and non-technological outputs. On the other hand, the project consortium itself is a STEAM team, combining different working methodologies at the intersection between creative design practice and design-driven research with scientific, computational and experimental approaches. The work described has been carried out as part of the PELARS project. (PELARS was classified as a smallor medium-scale focused research project (STREP) and was funded under FP7-ICT-2013-11 Objective ICT-2013.8.2, technology-enhanced learning, under the work programme objective: ICT FP7-ICT-2013.8.2-b learning analytics and educational data mining. The project was awarded in late 2013, commenced in February 2014 and lasted for 3 years, finishing at the end of January, 2017.). This research and design project seeks to understand how students learn whilst engaged in openended collaborative problem solving (CPS) tasks during practice-based learning (PBL) activities. The main aim of the project is to create a learning analytics system (LAS) and incorporate this into a specifically designed learning environment suitable for implementation in three learning contexts, second-level science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects, and third-level interaction design and engineering education. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019."

This understanding and 'computational thinking' is deepened when they encounter the concepts in different contexts and environments, as opposed to only in one traditional programming language. In this paper, we describe how we used the Cinco Adventure Game Tool, a tool that allows students to model simple browser games in an intuitive graphical framework, to train basic computational concepts in a creative and engaging, learning-by-doing fashion. On purpose, we steered away from traditional programming languages, in order to separate the use of the concepts and constructs from the hurdle of a programming language syntax and development environment. The experiences with a large group of first-term Computer Science students in two successive years were very positive: The students had no problems in understanding and using the concepts, used the tool proficiently and enjoyed designing and modelling the games. Working together on a game project in small groups, they showed sustained engagement, developed a high level of confidence, and created quite complex games containing various fundamental computational constructs. © 2018 IEEE."

"Pirate plunder: Game-based computational thinking using scratch blocks","Rose S.; Habgood J.; Jay T.","2018","Proceedings of the European Conference on Games-based Learning","8","Conference paper","EN","Policy makers worldwide argue that children should be taught how technology works, and that the ‘computational thinking’ skills developed through programming are useful in a wider context. This is causing an increased focus on computer science in primary and secondary education. Block-based programming tools, like Scratch, have become ubiquitous in primary education (5 to 11-years-old) throughout the UK. However, Scratch users often struggle to detect and correct ‘code smells’ (bad programming practices) such as duplicated blocks and large scripts, which can lead to programs that are difficult to understand. These ‘smells’ are caused by a lack of abstraction and decomposition in programs; skills that play a key role in computational thinking. In Scratch, repeats (loops), custom blocks (procedures) and clones (instances) can be used to correct these smells. Yet, custom blocks and clones are rarely taught to children under 11-years-old. We describe the design of a novel educational block-based programming game, Pirate Plunder, which aims to teach these skills to children aged 9-11. Players use Scratch blocks to navigate around a grid, collect items and interact with obstacles. Blocks are explained in ‘tutorials’; the player then completes a series of ‘challenges’ before attempting the next tutorial. A set of Scratch blocks, including repeats, custom blocks and clones, are introduced in a linear difficulty progression. There are two versions of Pirate Plunder; one that uses a debugging-first approach, where the player is given a program that is incomplete or incorrect, and one where each level begins with an empty program. The game design has been developed through iterative playtesting. The observations made during this process have influenced key design decisions such as Scratch integration, difficulty progression and reward system. In future, we will evaluate Pirate Plunder against a traditional Scratch curriculum and compare the debugging-first and non-debugging versions in a series of studies. © 2018, Dechema e.V.

With the nation's continuing shortage of scientists and engineers, there is an urgent need for diverse students, especially Hispanic students, to enter and complete science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education at all levels. Contributing factors to the low representation in STEM areas are the lack of Hispanic youth's exposure to engaging and relevant experiences with science in their early stages of development and the lack of Latino scientists as role models that are visible, tangible, real, and inspiring to their communities. In addition, student experiences in math and science in the middle grades have emerged as a 'filter' that prevents many students from pursuing advanced STEM courses in high school and, therefore, limits their knowledge of and interest in exploring STEM subjects and careers later in their education. This paper presents a research-based approach to attract middle school students to STEM fields in a majority Hispanic region, using a game-based learning platform. The platform integrates computational thinking in the area of water conservation at middle-school level by using simulations and data visualization in concurrent learning modules. The concepts introduced in the platform are universal enough to be successfully employed in other geographical regions with different student demographics. © 2018 IEEE."
"Dragon architect: Open design problems for guided learning in a creative computational thinking sandbox game","Bauer A.; Butler E.; Popovic Z.","2017","ACM International Conference Proceeding Series","6","Conference paper","EN","Educational games have a potentially significant role to play in the increasing efforts to expand access to computer science education. Computational thinking is an area of particular interest, including the development of problem-solving strategies like divide and conquer. Existing games designed to teach computational thinking generally consist of either open-ended exploration with little direct guidance or a linear series of puzzles with lots of direct guidance, but little exploration. Educational research indicates that the most effective approach may be a hybrid of these two structures. We present Dragon Architect, an educational computational thinking game, and use it as context for a discussion of key open problems in the design of games to teach computational thinking. These problems include how to directly teach computational thinking strategies, how to achieve a balance between exploration and direct guidance, and how to incorporate engaging social features. We also discuss several important design challenges we have encountered during the design of Dragon Architect. We contend the problems we describe are relevant to anyone making educational games or systems that need to teach complex concepts and skills. © 2017 ACM."

The three lesson module dealt with mathematical phenomena providing participants with the commercially available hands-on construction kit, aiming to advance STEAM education. Pupils built original, personal, and individual geometrical structures by using plastic pipes in allowing high levels of creativity as well as of autonomy. Tutors supervised the construction process and intervened only on demand. A pre-/post-test design monitored the cognitive knowledge and the variables of relative autonomy, visual reasoning, formal operations as well as creativity. Our informal intervention produced newly acquired cognitive knowledge which as a process was shown of being supported by a broad basis of (soft) factors as described above. A path analysis elaborated the role of creativity (measured with two subscale: act and flow) to cognitive learning (post-knowledge), when flow was shown to lead. Pre-knowledge scores were significantly influenced by both creativity subscales: act and flow. However, relative autonomy, visual reasoning and formal operations contributed, too. In consequence, cognitive learning within STEAM modules was shown dependent on external triggers.

"Programming unplugged: An evaluation of game-based methods for teaching computational thinking in primary school","Leifheit L.; Jabs J.; Ninaus M.; Moeller K.; Ostermann K.","2018","Proceedings of the European Conference on Games-based Learning","8","Conference paper","EN","Game-based approaches can be a motivating and engaging way of teaching and learning, in particular for younger students. To evaluate the suitability of game-based approaches for teaching programming in primary school, we conducted a field study on Computational Thinking (CT). CT can be characterized as the ability to understand, formulate, and systematically solve complex problems, which typically requires abstraction, generalization, parameterization, algorithmization, and partitioning as processes of CT, which are also vital to programming. The employed CT course focused on fostering students’ conceptual understanding of computational thinking independent of specific technological applications and was based on course material from code.org. Lessons primarily addressed algorithms as a core CT concept and used game-based learning material to increase students’ understanding of algorithmic CT concepts such as sequences, loops, branches, and events. These concepts were first introduced through unplugged game-based activities using tangible everyday objects (e.g. pencils, playing cards, etc.) instead of abstract code. In more advanced lessons, students’ conceptual understanding was applied and deepened through plugged-in programming exercises. The 18 sessions (45 minutes each) of the course were taught to 33 3rd and 4th grade primary school students. At the end of unplugged lessons, students’ understanding of newly introduced CT concepts was assessed by short tests. Students’ interest in and motivation for programming education was measured with pre-and post-course self-assessment questionnaires. Results indicated benefits of the unplugged game-based approach for teaching CT concepts. In particular, we observed (a) for all but one of the CT concepts, students reached on average 82% of the learning objectives or more, and (b) students rated their learning experience in the course positively and reported high levels of interest in learning more about computation-related topics. In addition, qualitative analyses indicated part of the curriculum was very complex for the target group (e.g. nested conditionals). This finding is of particular interest for the development and evaluation of future programming courses for primary school students. © 2018, Dechema e.V. All rights reserved."

Once an anathema to parents and teachers, digital games are increasingly at the forefront of conversations about ways to address student engagement and provoke challenges to media pedagogies. While advances in game-based learning are already transforming educative practices globally, with tech giants like Microsoft, Apple and Google taking notice and investing in educational game initiatives, there is a concurrent and critically important development that focuses on “game construction” pedagogy as a vehicle for bringing computational literacy to middle and high school students. Founded on Seymour Papert’s constructionist learning model and developed over nearly two decades, there is compelling evidence that game construction can increase confidence and build capacity in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. This project is a research-based challenge to the by now widely questioned but surprisingly persistent presumption that students in today's classrooms are all by default “digitally native” and that those “digitally native” children are learning just by playing digital games. Through a survey of 60+ students at a largely immigrant middle school in Toronto, Canada, we present some important updates on youth’s media and technology competence and its relationship to baseline knowledge of computer programming and performance in a computational literacy game-based curriculum. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017."

Combining neuroscience and design thinking into STEAM, the program also answers a call by California Next Generation Science and Engineering Standards [21] for increased integration of different disciplines in inquiry-based approaches. The evaluation research study of the Brain Jam project was guided by questions of how this after-school program was implemented and the consequences for student engagement. The study also looked at the growth in science literacy and practice as well as design thinking. Preliminary findings appear to support the effectiveness of this transdisciplinary, interactive, and problem-centered approach. They suggest that ""folding together"" game design and neuroscience was effective in supporting deeper thinking and understanding, and increased student interest in both disciplines."

The main objective is to analyse characteristics and different limitations of so called conventional initiatives to attract young talents to STEM and manufacturing and to furthermore propose how ICT and game-based learning approaches can address respective challenges. The paper presents an online serious game EcoFactory aimed at raising the awareness of sustainable manufacturing targeting young children in late primary and middle school. It furthermore provides lessons learnt from the evaluation of the EcoFactory and proposes recommendations for designing game-based initiatives in order to attract young talent to STEM and manufacturing education. They are aligned to the requirements of four target groups, i.e. game designers, STEM initiative designers, decision makers and teachers. In summary, game design should be based on pedagogical scenarios and co-creation processes; should focus on particular STEM subjects without causing major changes to school curricula and content; and should create and/or involve wider community with feedback and experience sharing mechanisms. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017."
"Supporting spatial skill learning with gesture-based embodied design","Chiu P.-T.; Wauck H.; Xiao Z.; Yao Y.; Fu W.-T.","2018","International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces, Proceedings IUI","13","Conference paper","EN","Prior research has shown that spatial abilities are crucial for STEM achievement and attainment. The connection between the digital and physical worlds provided by embodied interaction has been shown to enhance performance and engagement in educational contexts. Spatial reasoning is a domain that lends itself naturally to embodied, physical interaction; however, there is little understanding of how embodied interaction could be incorporated into educational technology designed to train spatial reasoning skills. We propose several guidelines for gestural interaction design in spatial reasoning education games based on an empirical study with students at a local afterschool program using a custom-built computer game for training spatial skills. We present a series of gesture sets derived from an iterative design approach that are easy for children to acquire, show sufficient congruency to specific spatial operations, and enable robust recognition from the system. We also compared children's behaviors when playing the game with our gestural interface and a traditional mouse-based interface and found that children take more time but fewer steps to complete game levels when using gestures. © 2018 ACM."
"Engineering and Computational Thinking talent in middle school students: A framework for defining and recognizing student affinities","Cross J.; Hamner E.; Zito L.; Nourbakhsh I.","2016","Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE","15","Conference paper","EN","In this paper we describe our process for synthesizing frameworks for recognizing student talents in the areas of Computational Thinking (CT) and Engineering Design (ED) from prior research. Computer science education research has resulted in multiple, overlapping definitions of CT as an approach towards solving problems using methods and tools that are derived from computer science. Our development of operationalized definitions of CT talent for middle school educators is focused on uniting models for CT in a simplified structure. Our ED definition framework builds on multiple distinct models of the engineering design process along with concepts from systems engineering models and the design thinking process. We operationalize these frameworks to provide teachers with metrics and examples for recognizing and assessing the CT and ED skills of their students in non-technical classes. By training teachers to evaluate students' processes from the perspective of an engineer and computer scientist, teachers are more able to help their STEM-inclined students recognize the alignments between their own talents and possible careers. Through the analysis of teacher surveys and interviews from 19 classroom implementations, we evaluated the changes that the Arts & Bots program has had on teacher perceptions of student CT and ED skills and talents. © 2016 IEEE."

"From STEM to STEAM at the Beautiful Midden Field School: An Artist/Educator Perspective","McKeown A.","2018","The STEAM Revolution: Transdisciplinary Approaches to Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Humanities and Mathematics","2","Book chapter","EN","This chapter introduces the Beautiful Midden Field School Syllabus (BMFSS), an arts-led situated syllabus developed for students aged 16–18 years. Emerging from a short pilot project, the resulting syllabus integrates the extensive experience of an arts practitioner working with a range of media and diverse contexts, at the intersection of arts, technology, science and education. The BMFSS was developed to address limitations within STEAM education such as the need for a culturally situated approach, the inclusion of indigenous pedagogy, multiple world views and a systemic design-thinking perspective that integrates science. The chapter is organised in three main sections. First, the chapter discusses the transition from STEM arts to STEAM education. This is followed by an introduction to the evolution of contemporary arts practice beyond traditional genres such as painting and sculpture, outlining the potential of, and insights from, emergent arts practices for STEAM. This serves to support the evolution between STEM arts and STEAM education through the inclusion of ecological design thinking, contemporary arts training and the integration of science themes. Finally, the chapter presents an overview of the core BMFSS syllabus, its rationale and methods. Central to the BMFSS is the permaCultural resilience (pCr) framework, (McKeown 2015) which integrates theory and practice to develop a systemic transdisciplinary approach to learning that is creative, situated and embeds eco-social justice at its core. The resulting syllabus, adaptive for age and ability, forms the basis of a model of praxis for a situated approach to STEAM education. In conclusion, the chapter makes the case for an emergent, integrated STEAM syllabus, informed by an artist| educator’s active engagement over 24 years with the complexity of a situated approach to teaching and learning. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019."
"STEM storytellers: Improving the oral communication skills of STEM graduate students","Willoughby S.D.; La Meres B.J.; Hughes B.E.; Organ C.; Green J.L.; Sterman L.B.; Davis K.","2018","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings","0","Conference paper","EN","Members of the STEM workforce are notorious for lacking the ability to describe their work to people outside of their narrow fields. This primarily results from a lack of training in oral communication that focuses on how to communicate with the public. Graduate students do not receive extensive opportunities to practice the communication skills crucial for effective professionals. Most communication experience in graduate school comes in the form of presenting at technical conferences or presenting their work to their peers. The resulting inability to communicate effectively, and communicate to a wider audience, contributes to the void in scientific engagement of our citizens. As a long-term consequence, our broader society does not understand the importance of STEM and in turn, does not strongly support nor champion STEM-related policies. To meet the grand challenges that face our population, we need a STEM workforce with exceptional communication skills, as well as a society that understands and supports large scale initiatives to spur STEM innovation and bolster STEM education. This paper presents a novel oral communication curriculum that is being developed and tested at Montana State University (MSU). The program, called the ""STEM Storytellers Program"", uses a transformative approach to training graduate students that pulls knowledge from the journalism and performing arts community. Our program has three specific components: (1) creating jargon-less podcasts; (2) receiving training from an improvisational actor on stage presence; and (3) presenting at ""curiosity cafes"" to audiences from the general public. This paper will present the design of the curriculum including the overarching theoretical framework, programmatic issues, and recruiting. This paper will be of interest to faculty that wish to improve graduate student oral communication skills and are seeking novel programs that are being pilot tested at other universities. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018."

"A corporate-academic partnership to deploy game-based learning around the world","Christe D.; Bhatt J.J.","2017","2017 ASEE International Forum","1","Conference paper","EN","The challenges of the 21st century are complex and systemic in nature, demanding transdisciplinary and collaborative mindsets to solve. However, much of university STEM education still reflects an emphasis on instructor-centered content delivery, through passive lectures and uninspiring lab courses. This approach discourages potential science and engineering talent, disproportionately affecting women and underrepresented minorities. The university of the future likely will be an ""experience university"", focused on empowering learners to embark on personalized learning pathways. Herein, we present an ongoing partnership between academia and a multinational corporation to produce online gaming experiences to empower students, faculty, and librarians around the world with active learning. The Engineering Academic Challenge (formerly Knovel Academic Challenge) is a five-week game encouraging exploration of National Academy of Engineering (NAE) grand challenge-inspired topics. Each week focused on a new theme, presenting real-world scenarios to provide players with the impetus to ""pull"" from knowledge discovery platforms to derive the correct answer. Players can also earn microcredentials for certain behaviors in the game, a rising trend in 21st century academic credentialing. The game is co-created by a team of students, an engineering librarian, and a major technical publisher. To date, the two games have impacted over 5000 students in 530 universities worldwide over the past two years. Over eighty percent of players indicated that the game was their first exposure to the NAE grand challenges. Forty percent of players indicated it was their first time using either the Knovel or EngineeringVillage products. Players stated that they i) enjoyed the real-world connection of the game, ii) were exposed to knowledge discovery platforms to accelerate search, and iii) were very likely to use the platforms again in future research and development projects. The future direction of this work is toward a platform for open-ended STEAM challenges created by the community, for the community to empower learners around the world. © 2017 American Society for Engineering Education."

The broad objective of the course is to attract and retain undergraduates that have no prior experience in CS by using authentic problems that demonstrate the relevance and highlight the role of computers in solving ""real world"" problems. The course is offered in a variety of thematic ""flavors"" that leverage a student's pre-existing interests (e.g. in music or art), but all share the common goals of introducing students to the basics of programming, teamwork, and college-level study. While there is overlap in overall goals, the courses vary drastically in topic matter (e.g. robotics, gaming, music, computational art, mobile apps, security) and in pedagogical approach (e.g. principles of design, project-based student driven learning, and traditional topic-based programming modules). The introduction of this CS0 course has increased students' commitment to their major and success in follow-on classes. We present these successes and show that student GPAs in a followon object oriented programming course do not vary significantly for the differing subtopics and teaching pedagogies employed in the various flavors. Our report includes examining two student subgroups (those experienced with programming and those new to programming). Our evaluations suggest that the existence and goal of the course matter more than the specific content, with all subtopics and pedagogical approaches performing well. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."

The objective of our summer program is to serve advance manufacturing, as an evolving technology and to improve STEM education to prepare the new generation of high-school students (future engineers) through the use of the existing tools. Through the use of programs, such as CREO and Autodesk Inventor, as well as 3D printing concepts, both technology and basic traditional STEM knowledge, such as math and science were served in this program. These tools allow the students to reach their objectives without going through complex mathematics and engineering concepts and methods. This way, these projects will mostly focus on critical thinking and the development of creative solutions to problems. Without deep mathematics knowledge, students were able to conceptualize, customize and prototype their design. The visual nature of these tools (CREO and Inventor), and the 3D-printing technology enabled high-school students to grasp the technology and concepts very quickly. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the design and implementation of an experiment, from basic parts. In particular, we will discuss the lesson learned, such as: - Instead of going through the program chapter by chapter, we encouraged collaboration and integrated work through a set of projects. The students selected only five project that fit their needs and curiosity. - Going through the design process, step-by-step: define the problem, background research, specify the requirements, brainstorm solutions, development work, prepare the prototype, and finally assessment and analysis. Students have the ability to create their own designs using tools to reach a creative design and concrete outcomes. Most importantly, project methodology will be discussed. We discuss the project design program from the students' point of view, and the experience earned in design, integration, and also in written and oral communication skills. The methodology used to evaluate the effectiveness of this design program in term of learning outcomes is also described.

While this aspect is important, we recognize that the teaching methods in a majority of the STEM courses today are broken; there is a major discrepancy between the skills and mindsets in technical classes and the ones that are useful to solve actual problems in 'the real world'. Therefore, we suggest a new teaching framework called Data-X where entrepreneurial teaching methods developed in the Berkeley Method of Entrepreneurship are applied to advanced technical topics. Through inductive learning and by practicing story creation, stakeholder generation, adaptation, ideation, innovation processes, and by having a diverse mix of students being coached by a network of expert advisors, this highly applied teaching method empowers students to pursue and find solutions to open-ended projects and problems. The Data-X framework has been implemented and tested for three semesters in a UC Berkeley course called Applied Data Science for Venture Applications. In the class the students pick up, become comfortable, and utilize state-of-the-art tools in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. The results, feedback, and testimonials we have received upon offering the class have been overwhelmingly positive, and we propose that the ideas and concepts behind Data-X can help fix many problems in modern STEM education. © 2018 IEEE."

Supported by multiple real-world feasibility studies, the presented framework hypothesizes that if made easy to build, teach, interact, and play with robots, it can be a potent facilitator of STEM, especially in young children - an age group which is naturally curious and enthusiastic about new findings. The feasibility studies have been conducted in collaboration with regional libraries and museums to develop and evaluate the presented robot-orchestrated STEM learning framework. The framework operates on a twofold approach. First, active engagement with the target audience is established by leveraging proven techniques from theatre arts. Second, situationally relevant STEM content is seamlessly inserted in the active engagement with the target audience emphasizing on positive reinforcement learning. The preliminary feasibility studies have revealed overwhelming excitement and demand for this technology from kids, parents, and teachers.

"Co-Measure: developing an assessment for student collaboration in STEAM activities","Herro D.; Quigley C.; Andrews J.; Delacruz G.","2017","International Journal of STEM Education","79","Article","EN","Background: The shortage of skilled workers choosing STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) careers in the USA and worldwide has fueled a movement towards STEAM, in which the “A” addresses the arts and humanities. STEAM education has been proposed as a way to offer relevant problems to solve while drawing on creative and collaborative skills to increase interest and engagement in these fields. Despite the interest in increasing STEAM globally, research on the efficacy of instructional approaches, including ways to assess collaborative problem solving (CPS), is lacking. Results: This paper reports the development of a rubric, named Co-Measure, for researchers and educators to use to assess student collaboration, at the individual level, when students are working in K-12 STEAM activities. Our project team provides the rationale, process, validation, initial iterations to the rubric, and next steps to inform STEM researchers and move STEAM instruction and learning forward. A final rubric is provided and made freely available to researchers and educators. Conclusions: As STEAM education gains popularity in K-12 schools, assessment of student collaboration is needed to identify the dimensions of the skill in order to provide appropriate problem solving opportunities within instruction. The assessment is also needed to adjust instruction when students are not offered opportunities to work collaboratively during STEAM activities. Utilizing existing generalized frameworks of CPS provided the initial guide to direct research specific to CPS in STEAM activities. Using an iterative process to identify and evaluate attributes of student behavior associated with CPS in STEAM classrooms by a project team comprised of learning scientists, educational researchers and psychometricians allowed for rigorous research while drawing on appropriate expertise. Co-Measure has the potential to be modified and broadly extended to assess CPS in elementary and post-secondary classrooms using STEAM instructional practices. © 2017, The Author(s)."
"Assessment and learning: The proximal and distal effects of comparative judgment","Seery N.; Canty D.","2017","Encyclopedia of Earth Sciences Series","8","Book chapter","EN","The endeavor to support creative and innovative activities within the construct of testing, grading, and rewarding in a standardized, reliable, and equitable way is a significant challenge for every subject. Technology education supports the development of a critical and inquisitive disposition (Williams 2011), yet one can question the capacity to effectively and validly measure the capabilities that enact this disposition. This chapter highlights the importance of integrating professional judgment as a means of supporting a more effective assessment of the evidence and actions that allude to the characteristics of a technologically capable person. The chapter discusses the proximal and distal effects of using adaptive comparative judgment (ACJ) as a means of judging evidence of capability so as to demonstrate the validity of the assessment method while supporting the pragmatic requirements of formal education. The chapter also discusses critical aspects of the impact assessment practices have from the perspective of the teacher and the student. The chapter concludes by presenting ACJ as a central approach to effective assessment “as” learning. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017."

The target ratio for the number of students enrolling for STEM programs was not met in Malaysia for the 2015/2016 academic year. The main contributing factor is due to fear and low self-esteem although the students were qualified to pursue the STEM stream. The main objective of this paper is the development of a low-cost robotic prototype and module specification for increasing the interest of Malaysian students in STEM based on the Malaysian school curricula. To achieve this, survey forms were collected from the teachers to determine the main requirements for the modules. The main requirements identified from the survey were based on the quality of the module such as interesting, related to the Malaysian school curricula, easy to understand and implement, and low in cost. Based on these requirements, a low-cost robotic prototype and module specification were developed to promote deep learning through hands-on activities. This robotic kit has the capability to increase and sustain the interest of Malaysian students in STEM programs by providing learning-by-doing approach. © 2018 Authors."

"Research conversations for promoting interdisciplinary education, research, and faculty collaboration","Manohar P.","2016","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings","0","Conference paper","EN","It has been long recognized that one of the most important aspect of delivering high quality STEM education is to provide the students with an educational experience that includes a wide range of knowledge including not only engineering, science, and mathematics but also liberal arts education such as ergonomics (operation, safety, usability), business (economics, marketing, management, planning, corporate identity), aesthetics (form, visualization, style), and social, environmental, and cultural issues. In response to this need, the School of Engineering, Mathematics and Science (SEMS) at Robert Morris University (RMU) formed a Research and Outreach Center (ROC) in the year 2010. The center activities support the development of interdisciplinary curricula at the undergraduate level and encourage faculty and student engagement in interdisciplinary projects that could be later presented at the university, regional, national and international levels. SEMS-ROC demonstrates diversity in research backgrounds of the faculty and includes interdisciplinary interests of all three departments in the school. Research activities tend to cluster around several broad topic areas involving faculty from across SEMS disciplines as well as in some cases, from other Schools at the institution along with other institutions around the country. One of the initiatives undertaken at SEMS-ROC to break down the departmental-level and school-level silos and encourage to nurture the development of interdisciplinary work environment was the ""Research Conversations"" meetings. These meetings were held in an informal way to provide a platform for faculty to share their own research expertise with their peers and to learn from each other. This peer-to-peer contact also had a positive effect of finding common interests, explore overlapping areas of research, forming collegial relationships that blossomed later into multidisciplinary teams. Several research project ideas came forward through this knowledge diffusion which led to grant applications, the development of ideas for undergraduate curricula, active research programs and subsequent conference and journal paper publications. Some of these conversations were also summarized and published as Research Highlights newsletter after an editorial process to promote and advertise the research conducted within the university. Interdisciplinary approach for research has also been applied to education at the authors' institution. Two undergraduate course curricula have been have been redeveloped to incorporate significant project elements and engaged learning tools to enhance student learning and experience. One engineering course dealing with product and tool design is delivered in collaboration with Media Arts and Marketing departments. The other course in software engineering is now taught through discussions of assigned case studies and scenarios drawn from industry.

By integrating the arts into STEM, a four-part origami based curriculum has been developed, which combines the topics of renewable energy, architecture design, 3D CAD design and printing, and mathematic, science, and engineering principles. The modules are composed of familiar engineering education tactics to get students to think outside of the box like an engineer. Students reverse engineer origami pieces, build an origami chair using the design process, and learn the topic of renewable energies through interactive games. The final module pulls the knowledge gained from the first three together. The students design and 3D print origami structures that are energy efficient and utilizes at least one source of renewable energy. Students go through the design process with brainstorming, prototyping, and working models. The K-12 Next Generation Science Standards for science and engineering has eight practices. Origami Meets STEAM practices all eight including: (1) Asking questions and defining problems, (2) Developing and using models, (3) Planning and carrying out investigations, and (6) Instructing explanations and designing solutions.

"Learning programming through design: An analysis of parametric design projects in digital fabrication labs and an online makerspace","Chytas C.; Diethelm I.; Tsilingiris A.","2018","IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON","8","Conference paper","EN","The introduction of programming in K-12 can also include elements of other STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Mathematics) subjects like engineering design and mathematics. Parametric Design is a design paradigm which is often related to architecture. Emerging technologies like additive manufacturing (3D printing) and modern CAD (Computer Aided Design) tools have enabled manufacturing of complex parametric designs not only by professionals but hobbyists and youth as well. In this paper we present our empirical investigation on how parametric design and digital fabrication tools can support programming learning actions. To investigate the potential of parametric design in programming learning activities, we analyzed the code of parametric design projects from a popular online makerspace and workshops that took place in two digital fabrication labs and an informatics school lab. In total 45 students participated in our workshops and developed code to generate 3D models, while each participant had the opportunity to 3D print at least one artifact. We designed, implemented and evaluated the workshops using mixed qualitative methods to triangulate the data. The results showed that the parametric design tools that we used were well suited for participants to understand core principles of programming (like loops, conditions, variables, functions) and engineering design, bringing unique advantages to understanding programming concepts through the visualization of the generated 3D models. Moreover, the participants seem to have understood how to use programming concepts like decomposition and indentation to designate logical blocks in the parametric design code. However, in some cases more advanced concepts were understood only on a surface level with the participants using commands without a deep understanding of them. Therefore, we present some critical remarks on parametric design and digital fabrication in educational context and their integration with programming, engineering design and mathematics. © 2018 IEEE."

In the end, most educational robotics activities are done outside the curriculum such as in after-school programs and summer camps. The major contribution of this work is the presentation of a case of creative and non-intrusive integration of educational robotics to support the current school curricula. We present an example of expanding the curricular space, by integrating educational robotics in an existing course unit. In the absence of formal educational robotics curriculum and courses, the study presents an exemplar case of educational robotics integration in a creative and non-intrusive way.

Over the past few decades, there have been a number of national initiatives that have promoted STEM education with the goal of generating student interest in science and engineering and increasing the number of students entering the STEM pipeline. Research literature confirms that teachers are the single most important factor affecting student achievement and interest in STEM subjects. Several models of teacher professional development have been reported along with the evidence of the degree of their effectiveness in promoting student interest in engineering. These professional development programs are designed to increase the engineering content knowledge of math and science teachers, thereby having a direct impact on student achievement in math and science and helping to promote a positive attitude to engineering. This paper presents the design of a teacher professional development program offered in a predominantly Hispanic region in South Texas. The professional development program provides an opportunity for teachers to participate in engineering projects, become more knowledgeable about the engineering profession, and learn new pedagogical tools that they use to develop engineering-based hands-on learning activities for their classrooms. One of the effective approaches adopted by this program is the development of creative engineering connections between the math and science concepts taught by the teacher participants and real-world engineering applications that not only can K-12 students easily understand, but also find tangible and interesting. The paper also provides evidence of the effectiveness of the program strategies that have resulted in about 89% of the developed learning activities being successfully implemented in the teachers' classrooms. The results of the program teacher surveys and discussion of lessons learned by the program management are also presented. © 2016 IEEE."

As a step towards addressing this knowledge gap, a workshop was held at the National Science Foundation (NSF) to discuss the educational needs to prepare industry for AM and its use in different fields. The workshop participants – 66 representatives from academia, industry, and government – identified several key educational themes: (1) AM processes and process/material relationships, (2) engineering fundamentals with an emphasis on materials science and manufacturing, (3) professional skills for problem solving and critical thinking, (4) design practices and tools that leverage the design freedom enabled by AM, and (5) cross-functional teaming and ideation techniques to nurture creativity. This paper summarizes the industry speakers and presentations from the workshop, along with several new educational partnerships identified by small working groups. Based on the presentations and partnerships, the following recommendations are offered to advance the AM workforce. First, ensure that all AM curricula provide students with an understanding of (i) AM and traditional manufacturing processes to enable them to effectively select the appropriate process for product realization; (ii) the relationships between AM processes and material properties; and (iii) “Design for AM”, including computational tools for AM design as well as frameworks for process selection, costing, and solution generation that take advantage of AM capabilities. Second, establish a national network for AM education that, by leveraging existing “distributed” educational models and NSF's Advanced Technology Education (ATE) Programs, provides open source resources as well as packaged activities, courses, and curricula for all educational levels (K-Gray). Third, support K-12 educational programs in STEAM (STEM plus the arts) and across all formal and informal learning environments in order to learn the unique capabilities of AM while engaging students in hands-on, tactile, and visual learning activities to prepare them for jobs in industry while learning how to think differently when designing for AM. Fourth, provide support for collaborative and community-oriented maker spaces that promote awareness of AM among the public and provide AM training programs for incumbent workers in industry and students seeking alternative pathways to gain AM knowledge and experience. Recommendations for scaling and coordination across local, regional, and national levels are also discussed to create synergies among the proposed activities and existing efforts. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."

Instead of a common non-creative lecture/lab organization, we introduce a workflow of connected activities transforming a study process to active learning where both sides (instructors and students) actively interact and cooperate. We make an effort to revisit the question, how teaching forms and practices existing in humanities can be applied to a case of computer science education. With an example of programming courses taught at the University of Aizu to international students, we argue that any live activities (such as lectures in a lab, handson, testing and review sessions) are of extreme importance for involving students into a creative process. This approach aims at transforming one-way information transmission between a teacher and a student to their communication and, therefore, to better understanding of each other's perspectives. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery."

The relative merits of face-to-face instruction versus e-learning, especially in Primary Education, are still an open research issue, though. Another challenge that Primary Education faces is the development of STEM thinking and STEM-friendly attitudes in pupils of early ages. An educational intervention that attempts to address both issues is designed, implemented and evaluated in this paper. Motivation and engagement of young pupils are sought through the gamification of the learning process. The present study investigates the feasibility and the efficiency of an asynchronous e-learning scenario involving an on-line game, for pupils of 10-11 years, in the 5'h grade of Primary School. A basic STEM subject, Computer Programming Principles, is selected as the learning material to be taught purely remotely, through the e-learning environment designed and developed in moodle, for the purposes of this research. The educational intervention provides data on the learning outcomes of the pupils and on the efficiency of the approach. Evaluation results verify both the feasibility and the efficiency of this approach. Pupils and parents emphasize the role of the teacher who provides support and guidance through the platform communication tools; their attitudes are seen to change in favor of e-learning. © 2017 IEEE."
"The promise and the promises of Making in science education","Bevan B.","2017","Studies in Science Education","163","Article","EN","Making is a rapidly emerging form of educational practice that involves the design, construction, testing, and revision of a wide variety of objects, using high and low technologies, and integrating a range of disciplines including art, science, engineering, and mathematics. It has garnered widespread interest and support in both policy and education circles because of the ways it has been shown to link science learning to creativity and investigation. Making has taken root in out-of-school settings, such as museums, science festivals, and afterschool and library programmes; and there is now growing interest from primary and secondary educators in how it might be incorporated into the classroom. Making expands on traditions associated with Technology Education and Design-Based Learning, but differs in ways that can potentially broaden participation in science and STEM learning to include learners from communities historically underrepresented in STEM fields. STEM-Rich Making is centrally organised around design and engineering practices, typically integrating digital tools and computational practices, and positions scientific and mathematical concepts and phenomena as the materials for design. This paper takes a critical view of the claims about Making as a productive form of science teaching and learning, and reviews the current research literature’s substantiation of the ways in which Making supports students’ agency, promotes active participation in science and engineering practices, and leverages learners’ cultural resources. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

These included (1) identification of social issues, (2) identification of potential solutions, (3) need for knowledge, (4) decisionmaking, and (5) socialization stage. The learning activities could be highlighted as following. First stage, we use video clip of 'Problem of people about Sound Pollution'. Second stage, students will need to identification of potential solutions by design Home/Factory without noisy. The need of scientific and other knowledge will be proposed for various alternative solutions. Third stage, students will gain their scientific knowledge through laboratory and demonstration of sound wave. Fourth stage, students have to make decision for the best solution of designing safety Home/Factory based on their scientific knowledge and others (e.g. mathematics, economics, art, value, and so on). Finally, students will present and share their Design Safety Home/Factory in society (e.g. social media or exhibition) in order to validate their ideas and redesigning. The paper, then, will discuss how those activities would allow students' applying knowledge of science technology engineering, mathematics and others (art, culture and value) for their possible solution of the STS issues. © 2018 Author(s)."
"Technology education as a practice-based discipline","Strobel J.","2017","Encyclopedia of Earth Sciences Series","0","Book chapter","EN","The existing literature suggests a mismatch between what and how engineering and technology students are learning in the classroom and what employers and society in general are demanding from them in their careers. This mismatch between engineering learning and practice is rooted in a fundamental dissonance between what technology is and how it is taught; engineering and technology education programs continue to portray engineering through building the curricula and infrastructure upon the notion that engineering is more of a platform for conceptual understanding than a complex and contextualized practice of solving problems, achieving sustainable design, and/or employing creative skills, such as design. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a model that conceptualizes engineering as a complex and contextualized activity and to consequently argue for a new positioning of the role of conceptual understanding. First, this chapter briefly discusses the existing prevalent model of technology and engineering that focuses on the attainment of conceptual knowledge, giving primarily attention to its main assumptions, limitations, and implications in the context of engineering/ technology education and practice. Then, the discussion proceeds to some precursor frameworks of the proposed model that already exist in a more fragmented form, including frameworks developed in the form of theoretically derived rationales, as well as those models that have drawn from naturalistic approaches of inquiry. Finally, this new model of engineering and technology is introduced as a complex and contextualized practice along with its main tenets, how it reframes the fundamental questions of technology and engineering and technology/engineering practice, and the possible implications for technology/engineering education and practice. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017."

"A pedagogic approach to enhance creative Ideation in classroom practice","McGlashan A.","2018","International Journal of Technology and Design Education","9","Article","EN","The real intent for technology education is to prepare young people so that they may fully participate and function in human society. To achieve this aim, learners are guided towards the development of attributes that include perceptive, critical, creative and informed decision making. Although effective teaching strives to inspire the creative spark in every learner, there is little guidance to inform actual classroom practice. The selection of strategies and implementation methods that engender creative responses in students, is usually left to an individual teacher’s interpretation. A working knowledge of design processing provides a most advantageous methodology to guide teaching and learning as students develop ways “of knowing through thinking and doing,” Sharma and Poole (Des Manag Inst 20(4):64–74, 2010) within classroom design and technological practice. This article looks at the broad stage of Ideation in creative design practice, where designers instigate and generate ideas within their own practice. Insight and transferable skills are observed to inform classroom practice. One event from the ideation stage of design practice processing is selected to enhance student visual communication skills. A pedagogic approach is then shared to inform the implimentation of a teaching and learning strategy that has been trialled with design (aged from 12 to 18 years) and Initial Teacher Education adult students. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."

"Supporting progression to HE: the role of colleges and vocational courses","Gartland C.E.; Smith C.","2018","Education and Training","10","Article","EN","Purpose: Vocational courses in England support the progression to higher education (HE) of large numbers of young people from disadvantaged backgrounds, yet there is little research exploring the college experiences of these young people prior to entering university. The purpose of this paper is to consider the experiences of young people on Level 3 Business and Technology Education Council (BTEC) vocational courses in their progression to HE from differently positioned post-16 colleges in England. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative study was undertaken into the experiences of students on BTEC courses in four subject clusters (science, technology, engineering and maths, arts and humanities, social sciences and health) at both a Further Education College and a Sixth Form College in an area of multiple deprivation and low HE participation. Young people’s experiences of BTEC courses and the support and guidance they receive are explored through the conceptual lens of “possible selves” and using Bourdieu’s ideas of capital, habitus and field. Findings: Pedagogies and practices on BTEC courses are found to support the development of relevant social and cultural capital and help young people formulate well-articulated “possible selves” as university students, even amongst students who previously had not considered university as an option. The findings illustrate how differently positioned colleges support students’ progression and identify challenges presented by an increasingly stratified and marketised system. Originality/value: The study highlights the transformative potential of BTEC courses and their role in supporting progression to HE amongst young people from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. The current emphasis on standardisation and rigour as mechanisms to better equip students for HE neglects the unique contribution BTEC pedagogies and practices make to encouraging HE participation. A Bourdieusian and “possible selves” theoretical framework has provided new insights into these valuable learning processes. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."

"Kleptocracy and foreign corruption manifesting in illicit financial flows","Moorman T.C.","2018","Journal of Financial Crime","2","Article","EN","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify the place of kleptocracy and foreign corruption within the broader framework of financial crime. This facilitates understanding the importance of kleptocracy and foreign corruption as social problems. Two other aims are to better understand the most problematic components of a kleptocratic network and the most effective combatants of that network. A subsequent goal is to offer solutions from a broad range of interventions, including policy, technology, education, research and collaborative efforts. Design/methodology/approach: Theoretical economic concepts are used to analyze the importance of kleptocracy and foreign corruption. A small in-depth survey of 15 experts is conducted to identify the most problematic components of kleptocratic networks and the most effective combatants of those networks. The proposed solutions are based on a combination of argumentation, econometric developments, application of trends in related fields and material from in-depth surveys. Findings: This paper identifies kleptocracy and foreign corruption as one of the most, if not the most, devastating financial crime according to its impact on the total marginal utility of wealth. Experts identify foreign kleptocrats or corrupt foreign government officials as the most problematic entities in kleptocratic networks and the most effective combatant is identified as the US Department of Justice. By adding up fines and asset forfeiture related to corruption, penalties are found to be a small fraction of the problem in terms of monetary magnitude. Research limitations/implications: The paper does not attempt to make causal claims because of the nature of the paper’s purpose and methodology. Practical implications: The paper offers suggestions and methods for academic researchers who may wish to pursue a research agenda that is empirical and forensic with the aim of combatting kleptocracy and foreign corruption. The paper describes how information on kleptocracy and foreign corruption can be implemented into business and economics curriculum. Social implications: Kleptocracy and foreign corruption are important problems, and creative solutions are desperately needed. Originality/value: The paper shows how understanding and combatting kleptocracy and foreign corruption can be considered an interdisciplinary activity, touching on fields including technology, economics, business, ethics, education, law, policy, statistics and research methods. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Engineering Teaching Kit (ETKs) are self-contained STEM education standards-based units grounded in the constructivist philosophy of education and the principles of guided inquiry and active learning. An ETK introduces P-12 students to real-world constraints engineers must consider in developing their designs such as budget, cost, time, risk, reliability, safety, and customer needs and demands. Finally, due to their inherent interdisciplinary approach, the use of ETKs also encourages the integration of other subjects in the curriculum, such as history and language arts, into lesson plans, leading to an efficient and reinforcing project-based learning environment. The featured design challenge is from our newest ETK, Trash Sliders. Students learn about force and motion while designing a vehicle with a suspension system that will allow the vehicle to navigate rough terrain while retaining its payload. The vehicle is constructed from every day items considered trash, thereby bringing considerations of sustainability and meta-recycling into the conversation. The ETK was purposefully designed to be low-cost and accessible.

As this approach has been shown to increase educational success, it is vital to prepare and develop interest in middle school students to participate in STEAM subjects-related learning opportunities. This study examined the impact of hands-on global climate change monitoring projects whose curriculum was designed based on the six structured inventive thinking (SSIT) approach that can facilitate the development of the knowledge of STEAM content and investigate the perceptions of STEAM subjects by middle school students. The participants in the study were sixty-eight grade 7 students from a middle school in Seoul, Korea. Employing a quasi-experimental research design, the participants were measured on their STEAM knowledge and perceptions before and after participation. The findings indicate that students who participated in global climate change monitoring activities reported gains in their STEAM content knowledge and showed an improvement in their perceptions of STEAM subjects. The latter finding was more pronounced for female students who had significantly higher science achievement and positive perceptions of the STEAM program than for male students. The results of this study suggest that carefully designed projects comprised of SSIT-based environmental activities can be effective in STEAM education at the middle school level. © 2015 by iSER, International Society of Educational Research."
"Writing learning objectives that engage future engineers: Hands-on & minds-on learning activities","Barnes S.K.","2015","Proceedings of the 43rd SEFI Annual Conference 2015 - Diversity in Engineering Education: An Opportunity to Face the New Trends of Engineering, SEFI 2015","0","Conference paper","EN","One of the first steps in planning engaging, integrated Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM) instruction for primary grade children is to determine the learning objectives for the young learners. From clearly developed objectives, educators can select appropriate materials and activities to stimulate student interest, and to develop assessments to document the impact on student learning. Engaging students in interesting engineering learning experiences early is critical for motivating them to pursue engineering careers and to eventually serve as mentors to other future engineers. The impact data are critical for providing evidence of teacher effectiveness and of student achievement, information that can serve to motivate teachers and students to continue their engineering education. Two types of learning objectives will be discussed in this paper. The first type includes objectives for student skill development. These objectives are typically skills that are directly observable (e.g., the student will build, the student will create). The second type is what one can refer to as thinking objectives and are more hands-on &minds-on and less easily observed (e.g., the student will compare, the student will explain). For each kind of objective, teachers need to develop behavior indicators. These indicators can include language, such as specific scientific or mathematical vocabulary, that they expect students to use while engaged with particular materials, or behaviors that teachers expect to see, such as collaborating to accomplish a task or sharing materials. Assessments of STEM activities are unlike assessments in a specific content area where the teacher is looking for the student to demonstrate mastery in a math skill such as one-to-one correspondence. STEM activities, by their very nature, integrate many skills and learning objectives across the disciplines. The objectives and outcomes are not always clearly mapped to one of the four STEM disciplines, science, technology, engineering, and math, but are often cross-curricular in nature, addressing content, practices, and skills from not only the STEM disciplines, but also from others such as language arts and social studies. Curriculum planners and teachers using the standards from the various disciplines are presented with rich opportunities for observing student achievement during STEM activities. Examination of crosscutting concepts [1] reveals that ideas and practices of technology (system models, mechanisms and prediction) and engineering (structure and function), are integral to STEM education. Decisions on what goals and objectives to assess should be based not only on standards, but also on data that teachers have from diagnostic assessment results that provide information regarding what students are ready to learn and what students are interested in learning. This paper describes a process of developing meaningful, hands-on &minds-on objectives that willstimulate student interest in engineering, and support planning, instruction, and assessment of STEM learning experience in the primary classroom."

The PD programme utilized regional summer workshops, district-based leadership teams and distance delivery technologies to help teachers learn science concepts and inquiry teaching strategies associated with a selection of popular science inquiry kits and how to adapt inquiry science lessons in the kits to teach and reinforce skills in the language arts-i.e. to teach more than science when doing inquiry science. Analyses of the school district-level pre-post high-stakes achievement scores of 33 school districts participating in the adaptation of inquiry PD and a comparative group of 23 school districts revealed that both the Grade 3 and Grade 6 student-cohorts in the school districts utilizing adapted science inquiry lessons significantly outscored their student-cohort counterparts in the comparative school districts. The positive school district-level high-stakes test results, which serve as the basis for state and local decision making, suggest that an inquiry adaptation strategy and a combination of regional live workshop and distance delivery technologies with ongoing local leadership and support can serve as a viable PD option for K-6 science. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

"Implementing technology education in Finnish general education schools: studying the cross-curricular theme ‘Human being and technology’","Järvinen E.-M.; Rasinen A.","2015","International Journal of Technology and Design Education","17","Article","EN","In 2009 the Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture assigned the National Board of Education with the task of carrying out a nationwide evaluation of all seven cross-curricular themes. The evaluation is one of the largest education evaluation projects the National Board of Finland has ever organised. The present authors were invited to evaluate the theme “Human Being and Technology”. Data were collected during fall 2010 with ninth-grade pupils (the last grade in Basic School) around Finland answering the questionnaires. The questionnaire was completed by 1,181 (both Finnish and Swedish speaking) grade-nine pupils. The main focuses of the study are: (1) pupils’ knowledge about technology, (2) pupils’ attitudes towards technology, and (3) pupils’ activity know-how of technology. It seems that the development of technological ideas has not been implemented at all in HBT cross-curricular teaching, even though this particular section of the cross-curricular theme could have introduced something new and concrete that would steer pupils towards innovativeness and creativity. Paying more attention to this aim would better link visual art and craft education to this cross-curricular theme, particularly since it is only in visual arts and craft studies that learning of innovation processes is given as one of the learning objectives. It is particularly the contents of craft education that refer to the learning of a technological innovation process. The attitudes of youth towards technology and the development of technology were in line with the objectives of the national framework curriculum, yet the wide-ranging utilization and application of technology, let alone the further development of technology, has not been made possible, neither in this particular cross-curricular theme nor in school routines. A positive observation, however, was that the majority of young people understood the connection between technology and manual skills. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."
"Transforming institutions: Undergraduate STEM education for the 21st century","Weaver G.C.; Burgess W.D.; Childress A.L.; Slakey L.","2015","Transforming Institutions: Undergraduate STEM Education for the 21st Century","19","Book","EN","Higher education is coming under increasing scrutiny, both publically and within academia, with respect to its ability to appropriately prepare students for the careers that will make them competitive in the 21st-century workplace. At the same time, there is a growing awareness that many global issues will require creative and critical thinking deeply rooted in the technical STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) disciplines. However, the existing and ingrained structures of higher education, particularly in the STEM fields, are not set up to provide students with extensive skill development in communication, teamwork, and divergent thinking, which is needed for success in the knowledge economy. In 2011 and again in 2014, an international conference was convened to bring together university leaders, educational policymakers and researchers, and funding agency representatives to discuss the issue of institutional transformation in higher education, particularly in the STEM disciplines. Central to the issue of institutional transformation is the ability to provide new forms of instruction so that students can gain the variety of skills and depth of knowledge they will need. However, radically altering approaches to instruction sets in motion a domino effect that touches on learning space design, instructional technology, faculty training and reward structures, course scheduling, and funding models. In order for one piece to move, there must be coordinated movement in the others, all of which are part of an entrenched and interconnected system. Transforming Institutions brings together chapters from the scholars and leaders who were part of the 2011 and 2014 conferences. It provides an overview of the context and challenges in STEM higher education, contributed chapters describing programs and research in this area, and a reflection and summary of the lessons from the many authors’ viewpoints, leading to suggested next steps in the path toward transformation. © 2016 by Gabriela C.

"cSELF (computer science education from life): Broadening participation through design agency","Bennett A.; Eglash R.","2014","STEM Education: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications","0","Book chapter","EN","The phrase ""broadening participation"" is often used to describe efforts to decrease the race and gender gap in science and engineering education, and in this paper the authors describe an educational program focused on addressing the lower achievement rates and career interests of underrepresented ethnic groups (African American, Native American, and Latino students). However ""broadening participation"" can also describe the more general problem of a narrow, decontextualized form of education that can alienate all demographics. Broadening the scope of computing education can not only help address disparities in different social groups, but also make technical education more attractive to all individuals, and help us create a generation of science and engineering professionals who can better incorporate an understanding of the world into their technical work. The program the authors report on, Computer Science Education from Life (cSELF) takes a modest step in this direction. Using the concept of ""design agency"" the authors describe how this merging of abstract formal structures, material creative practice, and cultural knowledge can improve underrepresented student engagement, and foster learning practices in computing that offer broader forms of social expression for all students. © 2015, IGI Global.

"Integration of media design processes in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (Stem) education; [Fen, teknoloji, mühendislik ve matematik (FeTeMM) eğitimine medya tasarım süreçlerinin entegrasyonu]","Karahan E.; Canbazoglu Bilici S.; Unal A.","2015","Eurasian Journal of Educational Research","31","Article","EN","Problem Statement: Science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education aims at improving students’ knowledge and skills in science and math, and thus their attitudes and career choices in these areas. The ultimate goal in STEM education is to create scientifically literate individuals who can survive in the global economy. The identification of new learning outcomes, curriculum programs, and teaching practices needs to be clarified by the STEM education community. Media design processes are a potential teaching method in STEM education that requires learners to design digital media artifacts using a variety of technological tools. Purpose of the Study: This study investigates the impact of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) integrated media design processes on 8th grade students’ attitudes toward science and technology classes, as well as their views about these design processes in after-school science activities. In addition, it demonstrates the opinions of the classroom teacher regarding the integration of media design processes in science classes. Method: Using an action research design, 21 secondary students from a public school participated in this 14-week study. The quantitative data that was collected from the student attitude survey for science and technology classes was analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, while the qualitative data (student artifacts, PSA forms, semi-structured interviews, and field notes) was analyzed through open coding and thematic analysis respectively. Findings and Results: The findings indicated that STEM-integrated media design processes positively impacted the participating students’ attitudes toward science and media design activities. In addition, students were more motivated and engaged in the media design processes, which improved their learning of science content and participation in class discussions. Conclusion and Recommendations: The literature in STEM education calls for new curricular activities and teaching practices as well as the integration of art in STEM. In addition, the visual technology industry in this century creates a job market for the STEM-literate people who are able to apply their knowledge of STEM fields in visual technologies and art. In response to these demands, the positive outcomes of media design processes used in this study offer an encouraging premise in meeting the objectives of STEM education. © 2015 ANI Publishing.

"The landscape of PreK-12 engineering online resources for teachers: global trends","Bagiati A.; Yoon S.Y.; Evangelou D.; Magana A.; Kaloustian G.; Zhu J.","2015","International Journal of STEM Education","10","Article","EN","Background: The newly formed discipline of engineering education is addressing the need to (a) enhance STEM education for precollege students and (b) identify optimum ways to introduce engineering content starting, perhaps, from the early ages. Introducing engineering at the Prekindergarten through 12th grade (PreK-12) education level requires significant changes in teacher preparation and support. It highlights the need for developing developmentally appropriate content knowledge and pedagogical methods, thus revealing the challenges of preparing teachers to incorporate this type of knowledge base into their practice. Although professional development offered by universities, school districts, and other educational entities provides the primary source of formal learning tools for teachers, an increasing number of teachers also utilize other informal web-based resources regularly. This paper examines available PreK-12 engineering web resources offered by entities formally related to education in seven different languages, namely Arabic, CH(Mandarin), EN, French, Greek, Korean, and ES. Results: Findings showed how different educational systems designated different attention to the entry level ages when introducing engineering content. Differences in the terminology used to identify STEM resources for introducing these topics also became apparent. Similarities suggest that a large number of resources available on the web were originating in all researched languages. However, the developmental appropriateness and content validity of many of these resources remained questionable in many cases. In general, there was a plethora of isolated activities and lesson plans but significantly fewer complete engineering curricula available to teachers on the web. Conclusions: This study presents a comparative analysis of the international landscape of PreK-12 engineering education and provides guidelines and samples of state-of-the art resources in each language for teachers interested in introducing their students to engineering as a reliable starting point towards PreK-12 engineering information gathering. © 2015, Bagiati et al.; licensee Springer."

The essential challenge to take theory shown in class, to a fully realizable product, produced in a college laboratory will be explored. A distinction between classical and modern manufacturing engineering processes will be defined. In a design study, we will look at the fundamental engineering principles of an internal combustion intake manifold system to showcase the central integration of design within STEM education.

"Using science fiction to motivate learning and innovation","Sweeney M.","2014","Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC","0","Conference paper","EN","This paper discusses innovative approaches for the space industry to contribute to space education through partnerships with the science fiction industry. Unlike any genre, science fiction inspires imagination, innovation, and positive progress. It draws young people to the disciplines of science, technology, engineering, and math, and challenges them to make artistic visions into scientific reality. Among science fiction's creators, Jules Verne first imagined electric submarines, television newscasts, and video conferencing in his works. Arthur C. Clarke imagined modern-day telecommunication satellites. Isaac Asimov's works influenced our expectations for robotic technology. No doubt many space missions were also influenced by science fiction. The paper provides a brief history of space and science fiction industry partnerships, and explores new partnership opportunities for the coming decade. In particular, the paper will discuss how the space industry and the world's first comprehensive science fiction museum are working together to promote space education through science fiction. The paper presents an overview of the new Museum of Science Fiction's educational mission with emphasis on the role of industry partners in contributing to its programming and outreach efforts. The Museum of Science Fiction's educational mission is to use science fiction to inspire and motivate careers in science, technology, engineering, arts, and math. The scope of the museum's educational program is broad and designed to reach learners of all ages, from pre-kindergarten through higher education. Through interactive exhibits, project-based learning, and in-house programming, the museum leverages donations of talent, artifacts, and funds. The museum's partnership efforts also include concerted community outreach and advocacy to increase: the quality of STEM education, support for early stage technology development, and hands-on technology projects for early career individuals. By supporting space education through science fiction, the industry could increase the STEM education and workforce pipelines, and improve workforce retention.

The higher education sector of Africa has been decimated by the lack of funding and shortage of qualified instructors [1]. The shortage is magnified in STEM areas that require advanced training for the instructors and expensive equipment to conduct the hands-on laboratories. The lack of dependable laboratory equipment, especially in engineering education, has led higher education institutions in developing nations to focus more on the theoretical aspect of STEM education as compared to the practical applications. A possible solution to the problem is to develop collaborations with higher education institutions in the developed nations to provide targeted training on new pedagogy and state of the art mobile laboratory technology that will allow universities in Africa to teach STEM subjects with hands-on activities at a fraction of the cost of the regular equipment. This paper will discuss the results of an on-going three year collaboration between the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) departments of Morgan State University (MSU) and two universities in Ethiopia, Addis Ababa Institute of Technology (AAiT) and the Hawassa University Institute of Technology (iOTech-HU). The collaboration was based on the implementation of the Mobile Studio IOBoard™ (MS-IOBoard), which is a small, inexpensive hardware platform for use in a home, classroom or remote environment. When coupled with the Mobile Studio Desktop™ software, the system duplicates a large amount of the hardware valued at thousands of dollars. The project's major goal was to enable hands-on exploration of ECE principles, devices, and systems that have historically been restricted to expensive laboratory facilities that are not readily available in most engineering schools in developing countries. The results of the collaborations have so far been very promising. The students enrolled in the ECE programs at AAiT and iOTECH-HU have been able to use the new mobile instrumentation and pedagogy to work on new laboratory experiments and advanced projects. If successful, this approach can serve as a model of efficient and cost-effective collaboration between engineering schools in the USA and Africa that can be used to improve ECE education in developing countries. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2013."

First, it elaborated an interesting curricular idea where school activities were to centre around technology, thus creating a meaningful whole for the pupils, a sort of ""language of schooling"". Second, the Glass Project illustrates a utopian logic of educational reform.

Conventionally, these skills are promoted through design based learning tasks where students conceive, create and communicate their solutions to the problems posed2. Promoting a linear approach to a task which is dynamic and fluid stifles the creative ingenuity of students and presents unauthentic evidence of the design process3. In developing higher order thinking skills, through the design task, students are encouraged to record their design evolution primarily for the purpose of assessment. A stratified sample (n= 15) was taken from a cohort of first year undergraduate students enrolled on a four year initial technology teacher education programme. The study investigates the beliefs and values held by the students regarding the value they place on learning through design and the value they place on the stages of the design process. Students created their own personal conception of a theoretical framework that captured the stages and functions of their personal design journey. The frameworks were modelled by students, based on their beliefs pre and post their engagement in a semi-open design based task. The results presented highlight a shift in the value placed on the process of learning through design from students' initial understanding and their experience of designing following their engagement in the design task. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2014."

They have provided a forum for sharing: What we've done/seen: Highlighting successful PBJA initiatives they have done or seen and wish to trumpet. What we should do (curriculum): Pointing out where our curriculum is lacking in PBJA, and how to fix it. How we should do it (pedagogy): Sharing how a change in attitude/focus/etc. can make strides to improving PBJA. While the initial PBJA sessions evolved from a need to understand and combat the enrollment crisis of nine years ago, we are now seeing an explosion of interest in our field. There are colleges where the numbers have vast exceeded historic highs, with computer science enrollments up 22% in 2014 [6]. This PBJA ""movement"" was born out of this enrollment crisis, but is not tied to it. There is always value in sharing novel best practices and advocating techniques to make computing fun for beginners. This year we have gathered three educators who represent online, self-paced curriculum, platforms and community that together have reached millions of people. How does the online experience support or prevent PBJA in ways traditional classrooms don't? What innovative ideas did they employ to support collaboration, and how do they manage the ""bad elements"" of their user base? What is the right balance between easy-to-autograde, follow-me curriculum and wide-open, ""be creative"" experiences for the first-time user? Which works best, blocks-based or text-based programming? How can the ""big data"" from the mistakes of others be leveraged to give each user a personalized experience?

This paper reports the main results of a study based on 3 categories of country: in the least developed countries where economies start to evolve, mortality has to decrease and equality has to improve, STEM needs to mature; in developing countries, STEM can be seen as a need to drive economic growth; and in developed countries, we observe a lack of interest in STEM education to the benefit of business disciplines. We tend to evolve from linear/local (20th century) to non-linear/global (21 st century) approaches, where complexity management becomes a major issue (Boy, 2012). It was clearly identified that creativity cannot be treated separately from STEM, and Arts should be an integrating part of a novel approach called STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics). Longer-term socio-technical possible futures should replace short-term financial predictions that currently lead to chaotic economies. From that point of view, space technologies, systems and practices can contribute to improving STEM education technologies, systems and practices. Space is about cognition, innovation and risk taking. We are in a critical age where our civilizations are evolving faster than before due to information technology integration in our lives. We then need to better understand where we are going and invent our future on our planet Earth in the same way as we are exploring how we will be able to live on the Moon or Mars.

"The origins and underpinning principles of e-scape","Kimbell R.","2012","International Journal of Technology and Design Education","31","Article","EN","In this article I describe the context within which we developed project e-scape and the early work that laid the foundations of the project. E-scape (e-solutions for creative assessment in portfolio environments) is centred on two innovations. The first concerns a web-based approach to portfolio building; allowing learners to build their portfolios in real-time, directly from hand-held peripheral technologies in studios, workshops, laboratories, and from off-site settings. The second concerns the development of a radical webbased approach to the assessment of performance as captured in these portfolios. In many parts of the world, portfolios feature as part of school-based assessments-including those undertaken for school-leaving and certification purposes. In this setting assessment reliability is critical and (judged by practice in England &Wales) is typically far from satisfactory. The approach developed within e-scape has radically improved assessment reliability. Whilst these two innovations represent the most dramatic outcomes of the project, they arose from a set if principles held by the team of researchers in the Technology Education Research Unit (TERU) at Goldsmiths University of London. And central to these principles is that both the portfolio and the assessment approaches should be embedded in a view of active learning, such that engagement with them has a positive impact on classroom practice. As the title suggests, this paper outlines the origins, underlying principles and early development of project e-scape. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."

Informal settings allow for greater flexibility for integrating across multiple STEM fields as well as allowing greater freedom for students to explore potential topics and skills within STEM.

In this paper we present and discusses a bridge design and construction project-based learning (PBL) activity that was conducted as part of a two-week STEM camp run by Aggie STEM at Texas A&M University. The PBL was designed around a real-world scenario that the students could tackle in a smaller scale as an initial prototype solution. An engineering design process was utilized throughout the activity and students had multiple objectives to meet. As the problem had no single solution, students could safely be creative in their approaches and final solutions, as they were not focused on finding the one right answer. Learning outcomes of the project were: 1. the reality of problems having multiple acceptable solutions; 2. the realization that the existence of multiple acceptable solutions does not mean that all solutions are acceptable; and 3. that there is room for creativity in meeting the design specifications with the allowed resources. © 2016 IEEE."

Yet they can unintentionally disadvantage students with less prior gaming experience. This is especially concerning in computer science education, as certain underrepresented groups (such as female students) may on average have less prior experience with games. This paper presents evidence that a collaborative gameplay approach can successfully address this problem at the middle school level. In an iterative, designed-based research study, we first used an experimental pilot study to investigate the nature of collaboration in the Engage game-based learning environment, and then deployed Engage in a full classroom study to measure its effectiveness at serving all students. In earlier phases of the intervention, male students outpaced their female peers in learning gains. However, female students caught up during a multi-week classroom implementation. These findings provide evidence that a collaborative gameplay approach may, over time, compensate for gender differences in experience and lead to equitable learning experiences within game-based learning environments for computer science education. © 2015 IEEE."

The objective of this study is to investigate the potential of open-source (OS) technologies in an educational setting, given the combination of economic constraints affecting all educational environments and the ability of OS design to profoundly decrease the cost of technological tools and technological innovation. Methods: This paper reports on a 3-day workshop augmented with online instructional and visual tools designed for middle school and high school level educators from a wide array of disciplines (including traditional science, math, and engineering as well as computer, shop, and art). Teachers (n=22) submitted applications to participate in the workshop, the workshop was observed for both evaluation and research, teachers participated in focus groups (n=2) during the workshop in order to discuss their interest in OS 3-D printing technology and its potential role in their classrooms, and teachers completed a voluntary post-workshop survey and responded to follow-up after printers were in the classroom for one year. Results: During the workshop teachers built 3-D printers using OS technologies that they were then able to take back to their schools and into their classrooms. Conclusion: Through workshops augmented with online instructional and visual tools designed to provide facilitated yet self-directed engagement with a new, relatively unknown, and relatively complex technology, paired teacher teams were able to successfully build and use RepRap 3-D printers based on OS design in just three days. Practice: Here, we discuss both what the teachers learned and what we learned from the teachers regarding the potential for educators to construct OS 3-D printing technologies as a tool of empowering and transformative education. Implications: Open-source 3-D printing technologies have the potential to improve education through a sense of empowerment resulting from active participation, as well as through cross-curriculum engagement. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd."

The research tools consisted of a pre- and post-analytical thinking ability test, a science learning attitude test, classroom observations, student reflective journals, and semi-structured interviews. The findings indicated that STEM learning activities based on problem-based learning successfully developed analytical thinking abilities and attitudes towards science learning. Consequently, the students realized how important theories are, and were able to integrate their knowledge from various fields to solve problems and to create new innovations. About 80% of the students showed higher analytical thinking ability scores above the prescribed criterion of 70% of the full score. After learning, the scores of the students were higher than those before learning at a confidence level of 0.01. The attitudes towards science learning were higher than those before learning at a confidence level of 0.01. The successful activities of STEM started with offering knowledge to students through an inquiry-based process until they could construct the knowledge on their own. After that, the teacher initiated a problem situation and allowed each group of students to create a useful product adopted from the experimental results via integrating STEM knowledge to modify their creative works. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry."
"Two promising approaches to game-based learning in programming courses","Mozelius P.","2014","Computer Games, Children and the Internet: Technology, Educational Uses and Effects on Cognitive Development","1","Book chapter","EN","The use of games in educational contexts is an old tradition where mathematical and strategical concepts have been demonstrated and practised for thousands of years by playing board games like Chess and Kalaha. Discussions on pedagogical aspects of playing games for learning started in the 1970s based on ideas by the pedagogues Jean Piaget and Lev Vygotsky. In the early 1980s Thomas Malone analysed and described why it is fun and motivating to play computer games. Some years later Malone discussed his findings with his colleague Mark Lepper and together they specified the components of the taxonomy of intrinsic motivation. Programming is still a core subject in computer science but several research studies shows that students are facing difficulties even with basic programming techniques. These problems are not only related to theoretical programming concepts and studies indicate that students get stuck in practical programming and code construction as well. Some researchers see this as a pedagogical problem but also as a psychological and motivational issue. Other researchers and pedagogues have discussed the idea of using the documented strong catalytic effect of gaming in computer science education. There are at least two different approaches to game-based learning for programming education. In the first one the main idea is that students learn to program by playing tailor-made educational or serious games that are designed for learning programming concepts in one or several programming languages. The second approach is based on the idea that students design and build their own computer games. By using their creativity and imagination in order to construct their own executable computer games students will simultaneously learn traditional programming techniques. This study will describe, discuss and compare these two approaches based on data collected at the Department of Computer and Systems Sciences at Stockholm University. Findings show that both the approaches seem to have a learning stimulating potential and that they also might be combined. One of the main differences between the described approaches is while Learning by Playing must be classified as an extra resource for self-learning the idea of Learning by Game Construction could be seen as the bedrock for complete programming courses. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Such learning activities, while mostly used in universities, can also provide additional learning opportunities in schools. Current RAL technologies are targeted at undergraduate engineering education and offer limited operational autonomy. Opportunities for collaboration and experiment design are not well supported. However, both are important components of STEM education in schools. This paper discusses how RAL can be adapted to better support enquiry based learning in the context of STEM education. The limitations of current architectures are discussed and approaches to address these are presented."

Design is recognized as the critical element of engineering thinking which differentiates engineering from other problem solving approaches 2. Engineering design has the potential to integrate science, technology and mathematics concepts for students and is essential for developing technological literacy 3. For over a decade, experts have been calling for a push to increase technological literacy of our Nation's K-12 students 4-8. ""The key to educating students to thrive in a competitive global economy is introducing them early to the engineering design skills and concepts that engage them in applying their math and science knowledge to solve real problems"" 1. While a demand for technological literacy is loud and clear, many young people are unprepared to make informed decisions regarding the development of new technologies and their applications. "" The relationship between understanding engineering and technological literacy is of special urgency during the high school years, since ""technologically literate people should also know something about the engineering design process"" 8. ""Technology is the outcome of engineering; it is rare that science translates directly into technology, just as it is not true that engineering is just applied science"" 9. Today, Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education continues to be a national concern in the United States. Technology and engineering education (the 'T' and 'E' of STEM) have seen increased attention in recent years. The National Academy of Engineering commissioned a study titled ""Engineering in K12 Education"" which included a review of U.S. curriculum materials related to the T and E of STEM education as well as the relationship between Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics education. The National Academy's work emphasized the role of engineering in improving STEM education as it may be a ""catalyst"" serving to draw connections between mathematics, science and technology education 10 and creative problem-solving. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2014."

In the Finnish computer science education the teaching mostly follows a pattern of lectures, fixed exercise sets, and exams. With this article we want to open a discussion about possibilities of enhancing the learning environment by focusing on creative problem solving. We will present results from two research experiments in which we aimed to provide computer science students with a practically oriented learning environment with an explicit intention of supporting the creative work of students. There exists a vast amount of scientific theory about creativity, yet it is unclear on how to turn that theory into practice. Thus, our main interest was to find ways of applying creativity theory in practice in the context of computer science education. Our research experiments consist of a practically oriented computer science course, where LEGO RMindstorms robots were used as the platform for the student work. Methodological tools used in this study included content analysis of student products, observations from our learning sessions and semi-structured interviews with the students. The course was organised two times: the first time was in spring 2009 and the second in spring 2010. The total number of attending students was 72. In this article we argue that our approach of providing a creativity-supporting practical computer science course was a success. We gained a lot of ideas on how to support creativity, the students were clearly motivated, and they began to learn a new kind of experimental working style. The robotics kit seemed to work well both as a trigger for motivation and as a platform to support experimental learning, enhancing students' creativity and working style. In our opinion these findings are of great importance, and give promising practical ideas for the support of creativity in higher computer science education. © 2012 ACM."

What form these programs take can lead to considerable debate. In the search for some common ground the authors of this paper envisioned a school where children want to attend, where professional scientists and engineers work together with creative dedicated experienced teachers, and where the curriculum contains activities relevant to today's technologies and nurtures the creativity necessary to develop the technologies of the future. This school would be in a location where the students would have access to actual working laboratories in which engineers use state of the art equipment to solve real problems. The school environment would foster the creation of Integrated Product Teams (IPT) where girls are as excited and deeply involved as boys and students gain experience making presentations of their work to research and development professionals with comfort and confidence. Students develop the understanding that there is no shame in being wrong as long as they utilize what was learned to redesign and try again. Students willingly share knowledge with other students, desire to continue working instead of taking snack and lunch breaks, and at the end of the day when parents arrive to take their children home, these students beg for permission to stay and continue their assignments.

This paper describes a multidimensional dialogic framework in support of creativity in programming and the results of a successful computer science experiment, where the teacher facilitates the development of programming skills by means of the students random involvement in collaborative and creative dimensions of the framework. The teacher is called to pay attention in a great repertoire of productive interactions that enables him/her to promote creative programming activities. The framework presented here involves underlying dialogic processes from seven collaborative and creative dimensions that allow students to develop both adaptive and innovative creativity in programming. Students can simultaneously activate two or more ideas, images, or thoughts and have them interact, prompt thought experiments, change cognitive perspectives, raise new points of view, and risk category mistakes during computer programming. © ISLS."

Set against this context, this paper uses collaborative autoethnographic techniques to uncover and explore some of the possibilities and pitfalls of STEAM-inspired learning. Data for the study entails an email exchange between the first two authors of this paper, instructors from environmental and art education, respectively, who co-taught a transdisciplinary, split-level, design studio in fall of 2012. In line with the research approach, the emails describe ""epiphanies"" that were experienced in the process of facilitating the design studio which included students from Art Education, Environmental and Civil Engineering, and Landscape Architecture. Key possibilities and pitfalls identified in the analysis of the emails center around the question of how STEM disciplines and the arts might be thoughtfully integrated in a reciprocal manner. Specifically, the paper highlights potential difficulties associated with current understandings of STEAM education which, almost without exception, focus on the sole objective of calling upon the arts to increase the creativity of STEM majors. Concurrently, it is observed that insufficient attention is presently given to what STEM disciplines might contribute to the arts. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2013."

Edutainment is a kind of education which integrates entertainment for educational purposes and uses video games for education. It is a hybrid learning system that depends basically on narrative, visual materials or game-like formats, with less didactic address styles and on a more informal way. Game based learning or edutainment, just like other technology-based education methods, is being used in western or developed countries. Saudi Arabia is considered a developing country just like other Arab countries; hence, computer education has recently appeared in Saudi Arabian education. Therefore, studying this new development in the Saudi educational systems will effect significantly on the speed of developing the educational systems in Saudi Arabia. However, no edutainment games have been designed for this new curriculum. Therefore this research ultimately aims to design a new edutainment game to be used for the computer technology curriculum. To design an efficient edutainment game system, edutainment game effectiveness and the attitudes of students will be measured to know their technology acceptance level for the new edutainment tool and curriculum. The study is carried out using Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), based on four factors; usability, usefulness, ease of use and effectiveness. © 2014 IEEE."

Over the past five years, there has been several research efforts on curriculum development and the evaluation of game construction and playing methods to promote STEM (Science Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) concepts to middle and high school students. In this paper, we report on a new study following the lead of previous efforts. In particular, we were granted a block within Frank Hurt High School by the Surrey school district for which to develop a game construction-based curriculum as a basis for computer science education within the school, replacing a traditional computer science class. From February till June 2011 students were taught elementary programming using GameMaker, a digital game development tool. In addition to collecting students' overall impressions, we also evaluated students' technical competency (using tests) and self-efficacy (using surveys) at the start and end of the semester. Our findings show that the curriculum had a positive, statistically significant effect on concept comprehension, which suggests that the curriculum was effective for understanding computer science and game design concepts.

Pedagogical strategies in fields with an abundance of abstract concepts, such as physics or electrical engineering, additionally recommend experiential experience, such as laboratory experiments, as essential learning tools. To fulfill increased demand for engineers, additional educational opportunities have been created, which include online, remote and blended learning environments. Unfortunately, providing hands-on experience in these environments, which is as effective as in-class experiments in STEM fields, is extremely challenging. Different departments have developed online and remote solutions, from single remote introductory courses with online experiments to entire off-campus programs supported by remotely conducted experiments with mobile studios. However, in online situations, students often feel lost, have issues with the technology, and experience lack of engagement. All these factors can result in increased dropout rates or lack of understanding and commitment. Current trends in online education incline towards engaging students using gamification strategies to reduce dropout rates and to increase students' motivation in a playful way. Additionally, creating playful experiences for students can be used to attract novice students to this field. In this paper, we introduce a theoretical framework, which can be used to enhance online and mobile experiments with game design strategies to raise students' engagement and commitment and reduce initial onboarding obstacles. © 2015 IEEE."

Yet, significant barriers exist to students gaining such skills. Here we describe a new ""gentle-slope"" cyberlearning strategy that gradually introduces students to the authoring of scientific simulations via a Web-based modding approach called CyberMOD. Modding involves adding agents with predefined functionality to a simulation world to produce a unique combination whose behavior can then be visualized by running the simulation. This permits low barrier experimentation on the modded simulation, which is hoped to help students gain a deeper understanding of scientific phenomena that is the focus of the activity. Our research questions are: i) does this approach encourage students' interest in computational science and ii) does it enhance their analytical abilities, and iii) does it foster a deeper understanding of the processes modded? Here we take an in-depth look at what was created for the CyberMOD infrastructure and analyze the results of initial in-class studies as to the effectiveness of this strategy. The results support the premise that teachers can easily integrate CyberMOD into their in-class activities, that CyberMOD activities encourage creative student learning, and that the CyberMOD approach facilitates student understanding. © 2013 IEEE."

There are numerous factors that contribute to these disparities, such as poverty, low status and other sociocultural factors in classrooms that impede learning. Difficulties in STEM Education engagement and encumbered participation are often due to decontextualized learning - incongruence between meaningful contexts and learning processes. Game based learning methods are common STEM Ed models that provide youth with extrinsically motivating knowledge frameworks for learning, however, research has proven that even these procedural spaces often are disconnected from students' social and cultural realities. Amidst the STEM Ed achievement gaps problematic are similar disparities found in popular video game spaces, where there is a less than 20% chance that these same disparity groups will navigate computational worlds with protagonists that look like them. These gamers/students are lacking the under-the-hood (STEM) knowledge of the very games they engage with on a daily basis. This contradiction is central to this paper and the conceptualization of Metatuning - a game design pedagogical framework that aims to empower students to discover their identities as agents of change, and to see that game design can nurture their internal motivations. In this case study, Metatuning was used to foster an intrinsically motivated learning environment, where a young designer was able to iteratively design a social justice themed game that empowered her as a designer and an aspiring doctor. © 2016 IEEE."

"Educational gamified science simulations","Johanna P.; Gütl C.","2015","Gamification in Education and Business","18","Book chapter","EN","Modern STEM education is mainly grounded in constructivism. It requires instructors to not only recite learning content, but also to teach the concepts and ideas behind abstract formulas. Interactive simulations are one of the most powerful tools for increasing the studentsâ€™ problem-solving abilities, and enhancing their understanding of conceptual models and formulas, which are hard to visualize without technology-enhanced tools. Creating simulation tools of interest to students has the potential to enhance their understanding of the phenomena and increase their interest in science. However, many simulations are not engaging and students will lose interest in interacting with them after a short time. Hence, it is important to advance in particular the motivational design aspects of such educational tools. One idea for motivating students is the use of computer games. Different studies show the positive impacts of a game-based or gamified approach in the field of STEM education and training. Several theories and frameworks were researched and developed to support the game design and gamification process of various scenarios. However, only a few cover specific design issues and implications of educational and instructional simulations. In this chapter we introduce a gamification model, which is adapted accordingly to the characteristics of constructivist STEM education approaches with focus on the usage of science simulations. Therefore we will introduce a model for the adaption of gamification techniques to design, develop, and adapt educational simulations. Based on a background and literature study, a framework for implementing a gamification approach for different kinds of simulations is introduced and applied to an application scenario of our own research. As a result, both the lessons learned and further recommendations are outlined. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015."

Biology is one of the most relevant scientific fields for human life, and remarkable technological developments have greatly contributed to progress in biology. Advances in microscopy and genetic analysis have enabled the elucidation of various vital phenomena ranging from cell structure to gene expression. Recently, a technique that processes an enormous amount of data obtained in genome research using a computer has been adopted, and its relationship with information science (mathematics) has deepened. These facts indicate that biology education must shift from traditional teaching methods to modern science and technology.

Complex and high abstract mathematical learning materials have been identified as one reason for the dropout rate. In order to support the understanding and practicing of core mathematical concepts, we developed a game-based multitouch learning environment in which the need for a suitable learning environment for mathematical logic was combined with the ability to train cooperation and collaboration in a learning scenario. As application domain, the field of mathematical logic had been chosen. The development process was accomplished along three steps: First, ethnographic interviews were run with 12 students of computer science revealing typical problems with mathematical logic. Second, a multitouch learning environment was developed. The game consists of multiple learning and playing modes in which teams of students can collaborate or compete against each other. Finally, a twofold evaluation of the environment was carried out (user study and cognitive walk-through). Overall, the evaluation showed that the game environment was easy to use and rated as helpful: The chosen approach of a multiplayer game supporting competition, collaboration, and cooperation is perceived as motivating and ""fun."". © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."
"Video gaming for STEM education","Hyatt K.J.; Barron J.L.; Noakes M.A.","2014","STEM Education: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications","0","Book chapter","EN","The focus of this chapter is how video games can be utilized for instructional purposes, specifically in the STEM areas (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). Gaming, as an instructional tool, enables educators to create participatory learning activities, assess understanding of complex and ill-formed situations, facilitate critical thinking and problem solving capabilities, and ensure active engagement across the learning continuum for all students. How to use it effectively, however, is a topic of debate among many educational scholars. In order to create innovative ways to teach classic concepts using video games, instructors need diverse skills: technology skills to access video games that meet the needs of today's learners for active engagement, instructional skills to integrate theory and practice, as well as adhere to the standards of academic rigor, and leadership skills to guide students to higher levels of critical and creative thinking. Therefore, this chapter will explore the vast world of video games and the opportunities for instructors to incorporate them into lesson planning. The basis of this empirical work is to align the guiding principles of STEM with the identification of accessible games, based upon learning principles and assessment strategies. The challenge for 21st century educators will be how to bridge the gap between the traditional development of skill sets to meet workforce demands in a dynamically changing global economy that simultaneously creates employees who are capable of innovation, collaboration, and deep critical thinking. © 2015, IGI Global.

Essentially, game construction-based curriculum takes the central question ""do children learn from playing games"" to the next stage by asking ""(what) can children learn from constructing games?"" Founded on Seymour Papert's constructionist learning model, and developed over nearly 2 decades, there is compelling evidence that game construction can increase confidence and build capacity towards ongoing computing science involvement and other STEM subjects. Situated at the intersection of 'maker' pedagogies and inquiry-based learning on one hand and game-based learning on the other, this field of educational research is just now more thoroughly being theorized and implemented. There is still debate as to the utility of different software tools for game construction, models of scaffolding knowledge, and evaluation of learning outcomes and knowledge transfer. In this paper, we present a study we conducted in a classroom environment with three groups of grade 6 students (60+ students) using Game Maker to construct their own games. Our study adds to the growing body of literature on school-based game construction through comprehensive empirical methodology and evidence-based guidelines for curriculum design. We also discuss preliminary results related to computational literacy, in addition to a theorization of game construction as an educational tool that directly engages foundational literacy and numeracy and connects to wider STEM-oriented learning objectives."
"The teaching of creativity in information systems programmes at South African higher education institutions","Turpin M.; Matthee M.; Kruger A.","2015","African Journal of Research in Mathematics, Science and Technology Education","6","Article","EN","The development of problem solving skills is a shared goal in science, engineering, mathematics and technology education. In the applied sciences, problems are often open-ended and complex, requiring a multidisciplinary approach as well as new designs. In such cases, problem solving requires not only analytical capabilities, but also creativity and the ability to innovate. The development of an information system entails problem solving by means of design, hence creativity is integral to the task of an information systems (IS) professional. However, it appears that the teaching of creativity in IS programmes is under-researched and possibly neglected. This study investigates what is being done to foster creative ability of South African undergraduate IS students. At the same time, a theoretical framework for creativity teaching is developed. We find that the fostering of creative ability involves more than just the teaching of creativity techniques, and that creativity can be indirectly nurtured in multiple ways. © 2015 Southern African Association for Research in Mathematics, Science and Technology."

Engineering design can be instantiated for learning as they involve mental and physical stimulation and develop practical skills especially in solving problems. Lego bricks, as a set of toys based on design technique, are in line with the cognitive characteristics of students and provide a good game-based learning tool for engineering education. Many studies have incorporated Lego to investigate students' scientific attitudes, science inquiry skills, and problem-solving strategies, yet few address the effects of engineering design-based learning on pupils' problem-solving abilities. Therefore, this paper conducted an experiment and included control group to examine how fourth-grade students' science performance and problem-solving abilities change over the engineering design-based science learning by using Lego bricks. Results indicate that: (1) pupils' science performance significantly improved on both the control and the experimental groups, (2) pupils' gains of problem-solving ability in the experimental group were significantly improved, and (3) the males made a significant progress in problem-solving ability than the females in the experimental group. The key findings, possible reasons behind them, and potential benefits in the context of learning are also discussed."

"From dental bite to dental bytes: Students' experiences of a game-based project","Vahed A.","2016","Proceedings of the European Conference on Games-based Learning","3","Conference paper","EN","Globally, universities are focused on developing their graduates with attributes that will enable them to make a productive contribution to a knowledge-based economy. In responding to this, the Durban University of Technology in South Africa proposes four key graduate attributes that students need to exemplify: critical and creative thinkers who work independently and collaboratively; knowledgeable practitioners; active and reflective learners; and effective communicators. To facilitate the attainment of these skills lecturers are encouraged to use student-centred teaching practices. Project-Based Learning is one such approach that can facilitate the attainment of the aforementioned attributes. It is against this background that a web-based game project called Dental Bytes emerged. This involved the transdisciplinary collaboration between a Dental Technologist, eight third-year Information Technology (IT) students and their lecturer. This paper uses the Framework for the Rational Analysis of Technology Education (FRATE) model, which is an adapted version of the Framework for the Rational Analysis of Mobile Education (FRAME) model, to explore students' interdisciplinary leaning experiences of designing and developing Dental Bytes. The developmental phase of the game is presented in order to demonstrate how project-based approaches foster highly engaging learning experiences that are problem-centred and pedagogically sound. A case study research design within a qualitative framework was adopted. Data was collected by means of students' reflective reports, which were analysed in terms of the Interaction Learning Intersection frame of the FRATE model. Essentially, this project facilitated the epistemological development of students by providing them with a real world scenario of working with a client to enhance their information technology knowledge. Furthermore, this project assisted with developing their skills, abilities and dispositions to help them make informed decisions; self-manage their tasks (including their learning of Dental Technology); and to act in a socially responsible way both within, and beyond, the classroom. Overall, the salient features of this paper show that the IT project facilitated the attainment of graduate attributes, which is a bedrock of student centeredness and engagement. © The Authors, 2016.

"Students' use of evidence-based reasoning in K-12 engineering: A case study (fundamental)","Mathis C.A.; Siverling E.A.; Glancy A.W.; Guzey S.S.; Moore T.J.","2016","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings","22","Conference paper","EN","It is well known that the United States is concerned about the low numbers of students prepared for careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), which is necessary to remain internationally competitive1,2. As a result, improving STEM education in precollege settings has become a focal point because not only can it prepare students for these careers of the future, may also increase the STEM literacy of all students3. Part of this effort to increase K-12 STEM education is a movement to provide standards that are STEM-focused and include engineering design, which is already underway at the state and national levels4-8. Although policy and standards may help increase the number of students interested in STEM, additional efforts are needed to equip students with the technical and professional skills required by those careers. Regardless of the STEM career, employers want employees who can solve problems, think critically, communicate, work in teams, collaborate effectively, and have technical skills9. This means that K-12 teachers need to help students develop professional skills, as well as teach STEM content knowledge. The research presented here concerns the professional practice of using evidence to support idea generation and decision making within engineering, commonly called argumentation. While there are a number of professional practices that students need to engage in and learn, argumentation in particular has drawn the attention of K-12 educators in many disciplines, including EN language arts, history, and STEM10. As humans, arguments are embedded in our daily lives. Children develop basic argumentation skills very early and may hone them with age and practice11. The educational system can assist students in developing argumentation skills10 through multiple forms of communication (e.g., writing, oral presentations) while also developing critical thinking. The incorporation of argumentation skills into curricula can foster students' ability to solve problems, reason with evidence, and develop content knowledge in all areas of education and daily life activities11,12. In addition, curricula that allow students to construct an understanding of arguments through experiences provide opportunities to develop social and communication skills needed by STEM and other professionals13,14. Although argumentation can be used in many academic domains, research has been done specifically about argumentation in K-12 science education and undergraduate engineering education. Argumentation is seen as essential to scientific discourse because it provides a framework for students to make claims supported by evidence and reasoning related to scientific theory15-17. Using arguments also allows students to act as scientists through deep discussions and writing research papers that persuade others of the significance of their findings and work11,18. Positive outcomes are also seen in the scant literature regarding argumentation in engineering education, though these studies focus on the learning of undergraduate students. This research has suggested that argumentation improves students' ability to think critically19 and solve engineering problems20. Currently, almost no research regarding argumentation in K-12 engineering education exists. With the increasingly common expectation that engineering be included in K-12 education, this is a gap that needs to be addressed. Thus, this study is designed to explore how student-generated arguments emerge within engineering lessons of an integrated STEM unit. For the purpose of this research, we will be using the phrase evidence-based reasoning (EBR) rather than the commonly used term argumentation in order to clearly distinguish between argumentation in engineering versus science contexts. A more thorough explanation of each of these terms and why this distinction is needed is addressed in the next section of the paper. Thus, the following questions were used to guide this research: • When students are engaging in an engineering design challenge within a STEM integration unit, where in their process does EBR naturally occur? • For what purposes are students using EBR when participating in engineering process of design within a STEM integration unit? © American Society for Engineering Education, 2016."
"Rediscovering the passion, beauty, joy, and awe: Making computing fun again, part 7","Garcia D.D.; Campbell J.; Dovi R.; Horstmann C.","2014","SIGCSE 2014 - Proceedings of the 45th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education","5","Conference paper","EN","In his keynote at SIGCSE 2007, Grady Booch exhorted us to share the ""passion, beauty, joy and awe"" (PBJA) of computing [1]. This led to a series of room-packed sessions at the following six SIGCSE symposia to explore that idea from different angles [2-6]. They have provided a forum for sharing: • What we've done: Highlighting successful PBJA initiatives the presenters have undertaken or seen and wish to trumpet. • What we should do (curriculum): Pointing out where our curriculum is lacking in PBJA, and how to fix it. • How we should do it (pedagogy): Sharing how a change in attitude / focus / etc. can make strides to improving PBJA. While the initial PBJA sessions evolved from a need to understand and combat the enrollment crisis of eight years ago, we are now seeing an incredible resurgence in interest in our field, partially because ""coders are hip and computer science is hot"" [9]. There are colleges where the numbers have exceeded historic highs, and some rightfully claim the crisis is over [8]. This PBJA ""movement"" was born out of this enrollment crisis, but is not tied to it [7]. There is always value in sharing novel best practices and advocating techniques that make computing fun for beginners. In the past, we either tried to gather educators who brought a wide variety of perspectives, who would focus on a particular issue, or who have instituted very creative and successful paths into the major. This year we have gathered three seasoned educators who have taken the leap and built online classes for introductory computing on three different platforms. What innovative ideas did they employ to support collaboration? Does the need to auto-grade mean students can no longer choose their own final projects, and how does that stifle PBJA? Do these autograded formative assessments feel like drill-and-kill? The hope with this panel is to explore how online offerings, in these crucial early years, extol (and perhaps suppress!) the PBJA of computing."

"Video gaming for STEM education","Hyatt K.J.; Barron J.L.; Noakes M.A.","2012","Cases on E-Learning Management: Development and Implementation","6","Book chapter","EN","The focus of this chapter is how video games can be utilized for instructional purposes, specifically in the STEM areas (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). Gaming, as an instructional tool, enables educators to create participatory learning activities, assess understanding of complex and ill-formed situations, facilitate critical thinking and problem solving capabilities, and ensure active engagement across the learning continuum for all students. How to use it effectively, however, is a topic of debate among many educational scholars. In order to create innovative ways to teach classic concepts using video games, instructors need diverse skills: technology skills to access video games that meet the needs of today's learners for active engagement, instructional skills to integrate theory and practice, as well as adhere to the standards of academic rigor, and leadership skills to guide students to higher levels of critical and creative thinking. Therefore, this chapter will explore the vast world of video games and the opportunities for instructors to incorporate them into lesson planning. The basis of this empirical work is to align the guiding principles of STEM with the identification of accessible games, based upon learning principles and assessment strategies. The challenge for 21st century educators will be how to bridge the gap between the traditional development of skill sets to meet workforce demands in a dynamically changing global economy that simultaneously creates employees who are capable of innovation, collaboration, and deep critical thinking. © 2013, IGI Global."
"Art outreach toward STEAM and academic libraries","Arrieta D.; Kern J.","2015","New Library World","7","Article","EN","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics (STEAM) efforts at Florida Atlantic University’s (FAU) John D. MacArthur Campus Library (JDM) to share methodologies and ideas with other academic libraries. Recently, there has been an emphasis on and push for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education in colleges and universities across the USA as a means for training future work forces and for remaining competitive in global job markets (Land, 2013). FAU in South Florida is a big proponent of STEM and STEAM education (Florida Atlantic University, 2012; Dorothy F. Schmidt College of Arts and Letters, 2013). Design/methodology/approach – As many librarians and outreach staff strive to remain relevant to their faculty and students with changing technologies (Drewes and Hoffman, 2010), the FAU JDM outreach staff have developed several novel programs that are geared toward the STEAM initiative. Findings – The Library Outreach Committee at FAU was committed to investigating how they could advance student success through visual arts programming. How can the library help contribute to STEAM education for the students and learning community as a whole? How can the library engage art students? Can the library promote dialogue in arts to the faculty and staff, regardless of their disciplines? This article will describe and discuss the various art outreach programs that the JDM has tested and their outcomes addressing goals toward STEAM education and academic libraries. Originality/value – The objective in sharing the experiences at the JDM is to spark new and successful program ideas at other academic libraries across the country and abroad and create knowledge in this relatively new area. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited."
"Designing Games, Designing Roles: A Study of Youth Agency in an Urban Informal Education Program","Sheridan K.M.; Clark K.; Williams A.","2013","Urban Education","39","Article","EN","Collaboration (GDMC), an informal education program in 3D computer modeling and 2D interactive game design serving primarily African American youth aged 7 to 19 years in the Washington, D.C. metro area, transformed from a program designed and taught by adults to one designed and taught by youth. In Year 1, 8% of youth participants held a leadership role; by Year 4, 30% of youth participants did. Moreover, the nature of these roles transformed, with youth increasingly taking on responsibilities formerly held by adults. In this qualitative study, the authors describe and seek to understand this role shifting. Through the extensive collection and analysis of field observations over 4 years, the authors describe qualitative shifts in the agency involved in these roles-moving from a conception of youth as student to assistant to youth as designer and implementer of instruction. The authors analyze changes in youth agency that accompanied their implementation of the studio mentorship model where classrooms were transformed from traditional teacher-led classes to studios with a 1:3 ratio of peer mentors to students. The authors describe how, following this shift, youth initiated new instructional roles leading to the creation of a mentor-instructor pipeline. The authors pose the GDMC program as an example to discuss how culturally relevant computing practice emerges from a programmatic goal of viewing youth as assets and actively seeking ways to support youth's initiatives and agency in digital technology education. The authors argue for the value of this asset building in technology education as a way to encourage youth from traditionally underserved groups to become technology leaders and innovators. © The Author(s) 2013."

"Pedagogy for pedagogy: Using a Wiki to promote the adoption, development, and implementation of Challenge Based Instruction in STEM education","Crown S.W.; Fuentes A.A.; Freeman R.A.","2012","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings","0","Conference paper","EN","Finding an effective new pedagogy with a proven record of advances in student efficacy and efficiency while challenging may be easier than establishing widespread adoption of such methods in academia. Challenge Based Instruction (CBI) is an inductive problem based teaching method that carefully encourages student exploration along optimal learning paths. Students are attracted to the learning objectives defined by the instructor using creative and carefully designed challenges presented to the students prior to the delivery of course content. This significant shift in classroom delivery, although proven to be effective, can be a difficult adjustment for faculty who have been neither a student nor teacher in a CBI course. As a part of a three year collaborative Department of Education grant to support the adoption of CBI in STEM fields, a Wiki was developed as a repository and resource of CBI course content using a method of backwards design and the Legacy cycle. Development of the Wiki was supported by over 100 STEM faculty from two institutions who participated in over 20 hours of workshops and workdays. The Wiki is comprised of participating faculty briefs on the development and implementation of a single CBI lecture for a STEM course. Over the course of the three year grant as new groups of 20 cycled through the workshops, the Wiki briefs served as a powerful resource for new faculty and as a useful platform for ongoing development and interaction. The site has recently been adopted for use with a Department of Defense grant to further promote CBI among faculty at four additional institutions. The methods used to develop and promote the site, the significant materials and templates developed, and the challenges faced and successes experienced in widespread adoption of a new pedagogy are presented along with conclusions on the usefulness of a Wiki for faculty development. © 2012 American Society for Engineering Education."

Investigating alternative teaching methods is essential to encourage students to learn and understand the concepts of programming. The use of games in learning and training is advocated and supported by many researchers due to its motivational and attractive features. This study focuses on an approach that supports the use of learning methodologies based on constructionist activities. Therefore, a pedagogical framework is proposed to guide lecturers who teach programming on how to integrate games-based learning to present coding concepts in the context of familiar realworld applications like computer games development. The framework is supported by motivational and attractive game features in conjunction with the authentic and meaningful aspects of constructionist activities for Games-Based Construction Learning (GBCL). This paper summarises and presents a framework model based on a literature review and a panel of experts, with a view to performing a two-stage process to validate this framework.

To help Thai students make sense of relationship between Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, this paper presents learning activities of STS Circular Motion Unit. The developing of STS Circular Motion Unit is a part of research that aimed to enhance students’ perception of the relationship between Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics. This paper will discuss how to develop Circular Motion Unit through STS approach in framework of Yuenyong (2006) where learning activities were provided based on 5 stages. These included (1) identification of social issues, (2) identification of potential solutions, (3) need for knowledge, (4) decision-making, and (5) socialization stage. The learning activities could be highlighted as following. First stage, we use video clip of ‘Trucks fail to negotiate dangerous bend in road-Brazil’. Second stage, students will need to identification of potential solutions by design safety road. The need of scientific and other knowledge will be proposed for various alternative solutions. Third stage, students will gain their scientific knowledge through laboratory and demonstration of circular motion. Fourth stage, students have to make decision for the best solution of designing safety road based on their scientific knowledge and others (e.g. mathematics, economics, art, value, and so on). Finally, students will present and share their Design Safety Road in society (e.g. social media or exhibition) in order to validate their ideas and redesigning.

Robots and interactive installations are some of the most widespread artifacts for increasing students' adoption in CSE. But what kind of emotions motivate students to participate in such creative development activities? In this paper we present the results of an empirical investigation regarding the key emotions and their impact on a creative learning context. In our empirical evaluation, a group of researchers and artists designed, implemented, and evaluated three workshop programs. The workshops were based on the Reggio Emilia education principles, open source software Scratch and Arduino and were conducted in creative centers. We designed a survey, based on the main Emotional factors identified from the literature as important on the technology context. Responses from 37 twelve-year-old girls were used to examine the effect of Enjoyment, Happiness and Anxiety on students' intention to participate on similar creative development activities. Results confirmed the positive effects of Happiness and the negative effect of Anxiety. Moreover, the results indicated that students' Enjoyment has no relation with students' intention to re-participate in an activity. The overall outcomes are expected to contribute to design practices and promote the acceptance of creative development activities. © 2014 Springer International Publishing."

"Development of gesture recognition-based steam educational games focused on Korean traditional archery","Kim H.S.; Oh S.H.; Park Y.H.","2016","Communications in Computer and Information Science","1","Conference paper","EN","The purpose of this study was to develop the gesture recognitionbased STEAM educational game focused on Korean traditional archery. The game adopted the story of the Korean movie War of the Arrows and included educational contents based on the scientific principles of archery to help users shoot well in archery games. The game was demonstrated at the exhibition booths in the BIFF Village during the 2015 Busan International Film Festival (BIFF). Learning through body movements based on scientific knowledge could be a good approach for designing STEAM education program. The program’s contents include the scientific principles of archery, such as kinetic energy, kinematics of projectile motion, and predicted aiming method. The first key issue in the development was the robustness and usability of the gesture recognition system for onsite installation. The second key issue was the customized content for immediately increasing the interests of users. The difficulty of the game was determined by the archery target size and control. The user controlled the game with his or her own gestures: Aim was controlled by the user’s left hand, and the firing gesture required putting the user’s right hand up. We tested the gesture recognition-based art education game with many participants at the exhibition. Participants’ reaction was very favorable. Most people could play the game easily and intuitively. After the experience, users’ feedback was almost entirely positive. However, kids younger than six years old and elderly people over sixty-five could not play the game as easily. These facts should be considered for an educational game design. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."

"Development and implementation of i-Laboratory for instrumentation, sensors, measurements and controls courses","Belu R.G.; Husanu I.N.C.","2012","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings","0","Conference paper","EN","Computing, information and communication technologies have strong impacts on education, by significantly improving the distance and online collaborative learning, via the virtual or remote experiments and simulations. One of the distinguishing features of engineering technology education is the laboratory work and hands-on experience as an integral part of the curricula. Their purpose is bringing the students closer to real situations that they may encounter in industrial settings. Instrumentation and measurement (I&M) are among the most important concepts that students learn in the course of engineering programs. Laboratory assignments illustrating these techniques provide students with learning opportunities and practical experience, encouraging sustained student interest and retention. Unfortunately, incorporating laboratory experimental student activities in engineering curricula is constrained by space, administrative and budget limitations. On the other hand online engineering practice is offering nowadays new potential for training in sensors and measurement technologies and procedures. Virtual laboratories add a significant value to engineering curricula in a variety of cases. Whether it is a complement to a hands-on experience or a substitute when a traditional lab is not feasible, virtual laboratories are a valuable educational resource. Virtual and remote-controlled experiments are originated from the attractive opportunity of exploiting the Internet advantages to control instrumentation and conduct measurement processes from any location and at any time. This project intends to provide more efficient sharing of expensive measurement equipment. We are planning to develop a set of virtual and remote-controlled measurement experiments, such as: transducer electronic data sheet creation and testing, mechanical material characteristics, acceleration and speed measurements, temperature sensor characterization, etc. Students will be able to conduct any of these experiments on their own schedule. By contrast to a traditional lab that requires multiple workstations to be placed in a physical space and attended by trained staff, i-Labs can provide the use of a workstation simultaneously to several students. Therefore it provides laboratory activities for students at a relatively low cost per user. Other important features of remote and virtual labs are: availability, security, flexibility, and portability. Our planned i-Lab allowing the users to perform real measurements, sensor tests and calibrations may be used on a wide variety of other courses with minimal administrative cost. Two strategies are planned to be used in our design and implementation: the use of proprietary languages like LabVIEW and MATLAB-Simulink and the use of standard programming languages. The success of this project in an education and research-oriented experimental facility will advance the state of art of education in the fields such as I&M, sensors and controls by contributing to new experimental concepts, and simulations, and by creating a motivating environment for the engineering practice. The i-Lab set-ups planned to be developed during this project are used in both ET undergraduate and graduate courses. They also may be used as models for the similar developments in other courses. © 2012 American Society for Engineering Education."

Many graduates enter the work force with exceptional development skills, but lack proficiency in test, debugging, and analysis skills. This is in part because academic curricula emphasize development at the expense of teaching software testing as a formal engineering discipline. The majority of curricula today emphasize the initial phases of a development life cycle, namely: requirements gathering, architecture design, and implementation. The skills which are retained in this area of test are often learned ad-hoc while working on solutions for an implementation-oriented course. The lack of formal test education among graduates forces industry to spend substantial resources to properly educate graduates in the art and science of software testing.

There is a large gap between conventional wisdom, which maintains that technology education is intended to foster creative thinking among pupils, and reality in the field. The case study presented is that of a mid-sized Israeli industrial plant, dealing with the design and production of construction tools for professionals and domestic use, such as spirit levels, measuring tapes, squares and rulers. This plant utilized innovation, uniqueness and quality as the main instruments in the battle for the market. A series of workshops for the plant's staff, entitled 'Systematic Inventive Thinking', resulted in the development of a range of new, original and successful products. The cumulative experience indicated that people can learn efficient techniques for solving a problem, or developing a new product, by breaking it down to its basic components, by 'playing' systematically with ideas, in order to achieve new results. The notion that methodical courses can trigger pupils' incentive to be innovative and original, and can foster teamwork is almost absent from the field of education. Educators and scholars in technology education pay little regard to teaching and exploiting methods to fostering systematic original thinking and problem-solving. The challenge in education is to find an optimal combination and balance between fostering activity based on openness and 'disorder', on the one hand, and imparting systematic methods for innovative thinking and problem-solving, on the other."
"Towards social gaming methods for improving game-based computer science education","Hicks A.","2010","FDG 2010 - Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on the Foundations of Digital Games","7","Conference paper","EN","Participation, retention, and overall performance in introductory CS students could be improved by removing or reducing some of the pitfalls along these students' paths. In introductory coursework, there is little or no need for collaboration, which may discourage socially-oriented students. Furthermore, the dual challenge of learning a programming language and covering more abstract, conceptual concepts may discourage students with little prior experience, and frustrate those who are already capable programmers. To remedy this, we will investigate social mechanics for learning games. We hypothesize that students will develop the skills necessary to succeed in the game more readily if friends are present to motivate and challenge them. We plan to explore effective social mechanics, and create efficient methodologies for their implementation and development. We believe that social gaming has the potential to revolutionize the way students learn, and that through our research, we will discover the most effective ways to bring students together and motivate creativity, innovation, and learning using social gaming. © 2010 ACM."
"Teaching introductory information technology through EN in China: Innovative approaches to information technology education","Huang H.; Towey D.","2010","ICEIT 2010 - 2010 International Conference on Educational and Information Technology, Proceedings","3","Conference paper","EN","The United International College (UIC) is a new Liberal Arts college in Southern China, whose goals include creating an innovative international education model for China that can contribute to the welfare of the nation and the world. All non-Computer Science major students in UIC are required to take an introductory Information technology (IT) course. This paper identifies some of the special challenges facing the design and delivery of such a course in the Mainland CHcontext, especially in an EN medium of instruction institution. It traces the evolution of the course as UIC itself evolved from a pilot launch in 2005 with about 300 students, to the current full capacity 4, 000 undergraduates. As the course content departed more and more from similarly titled courses in Mainland China, resistance from both faculty and students was met, resulting in some fundamental changes in the course vision and design. The high student: staff ratio for the course also required some innovative steps to ensure not only that the fundamental course material was being absorbed, but also that the experience of becoming IT-literate was, as much as possible, an enjoyable one. The changing (academic) profile of the UIC student has also required that the course management team adapt: most students in 2005 had a weaker academic background, spoke Cantonese, and often had difficulties with EN proficiency; new students in more recent years have stronger academic credentials, come from many different parts of Mainland China (and speak Putonghua rather than Cantonese), and have a comparatively high EN proficiency. This paper also explains some of the various IT and multimedia tools adopted to enhance the learning experience for students, and discusses some of the fundamental delivery structure decisions that have resulted in the current IT1010 course. Directions for the future of the course, and the teaching of computer literacy to non-Computer Science students in general, are also outlined. © 2010 IEEE."
"Challenges facing continuous professional development for technology education in Irish second level education","McCarthy D.; Seery N.; Gordon S.","2010","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings","0","Conference paper","EN","As the demand for graduates of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics increases, fewer second level students are choosing to pursue a third level qualification within the STEM disciplines. This dichotomous relationship is compounded by the recent trend showing a decline in the uptake of technological based subjects at second level. Over the past 4 years, in an attempt to stimulate technological education, the Department of Education and Science has modernised the entire suite of traditional craft based syllabi to foster a design and creative culture. This brought with it an unprecedented amount of new material, the need for philosophical change and a dynamic learning approach. The challenges facing contemporary teaching and learning centres on interpreting, realising and delivering the philosophical changes that accompanies educational reform. The focus of traditional subjects centred on prescribed project based outcomes that enabled practitioners form the role of a didactic director, the new contemporaneous suite of subject's call for a mentoring model of facilitation. The role of the Technology Education Research group at the University of Limerick as the sole provider of pre service technology teachers is to inform the direction of a sustainable approach to a fluid dynamic technological education. Therefore this paper explores the approach taken to continue professional development of second level technology teachers in Ireland and analyses the CPD model utilised, the focus of training events, and the operation of a national in-service strategy. The study highlights the response of practicing technology educators to the demands of the new syllabi and illustrates a significant level of engagement in in-service activities. The establishment of the self directed, peer driven Teacher Professional Network (TPN) is evidence of their intrinsic motivation to meet the challenges and requirements facing the STEM disciplines. This paper further investigates contemporary pedagogical strategies and innovative approaches to teaching and learning. In conclusion the study presents principle recommendations to complimenting the current in-service model and significantly outlines a sustainable paradigm of CPD that promotes the progression of technological literacy and competency. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2010."
"Laboratories in the Computer Science Curriculum","Parker J.; Cupper R.; Kelemen C.; Molnar D.; Scragg G.","1990","Computer Science Education","23","Article","EN","From the beginning, the discipline of computer science has been a laboratory science. In this regard, it stands alongside biology, chemistry, geology, and physics, where students and practitioners formulate conjectures and then design and carry out experiments to study the validity of those conjectures. The laboratory is an integral component of both education and practice in these sciences. In computer science, the laboratory component has been less formal, and most laboratory work has been performed in computer centers, sharing the resources with those who use computers as tools in other disciplines. This arrangement has been unsatisfactory for a number of reasons. It is, therefore, appropriate and timely to consider the nature and relevance of the laboratory session in the computer science curriculum. This report, which is based on deliberations of the Liberal Arts Computer Science Consortium, is a follow-up to the model curriculum (Gibbs & Tucker, 1986) and considers the role of the computer science laboratory in undergraduate computer science education. This report begins with a description of the laboratory component of computer science. The functional components of the laboratories will then be identified and translated into facilities required. © 1990, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved."

What role can e-learning strategy with focus on science and technology have in sparking innovation? Such e-learning strategy can be the digital storybooks which convey science histories or technology innovation stories with domain knowledge, creative and critical thinking, and problem solving - the basic ingredients of creativity and innovation. Learning occurs within a real world of our daily life. The connections between learners' script memory and contextual learning materials have a positive impact on meaningful learning. Therefore, histories of scientific findings as well as technology innovations would benefit science education especially for elementary pupils. However, there are a few story-based learning materials for primary science curricula. This study design and develop a digital storybook based upon true story of Taiwan young inventors.

"Multidisciplinary Technology Education","Petrina S.","1998","International Journal of Technology and Design Education","19","Article","EN","Contrary to a tale that is being told in the US, there is no transhistorical, universally pristine organisation of technology. This article resituates technology education in the contested, historico-political terrain to which it belongs. The current, and only, model of the technology discipline is interrogated in order to interrupt a project with roots bound up with a doctrinaire, academic conservatism popularised during the early 1960s. Following a lively critique of the technology mono-discipline, comparative curriculum is used for path-finding and interpretation. Counter to the mono-discipline model of technology, the conceptual parameters of a critical and plural multidiscipline are outlined. 'Multidisciplinary Technology Education' (MTE), inspired through efforts in art education, is proposed as a middle path between the technology mono-discipline and Design and Technology. MTE is balanced over four interdisciplines - Practice, Design, Studies and Criticism - with an end in technological sensibility and political sagacity."
"Future of engineering technology education","Rennels K.E.","2002","ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition, Proceedings","2","Conference paper","EN","Engineering technology education in the United States can trace its history back to the Wickenden and Spahr study of 1931, which identified the place of engineering technology education in the technical spectrum [1]. By 1945, the Engineering Council for Professional Development developed the first accreditation procedures for two-year engineering technology programs and by 1946, the first program was accredited. On this timeline the Purdue University engineering technology programs at Indianapolis can trace their history back to 1946[2]. Over the last 70 years, engineering technology education in the United States has distinguished itself by a history of evolution, development and continuous improvement. Engineering technology education faces significant challenges during the next several years. These challenges are driven by the rapid evolution of computer technology and changing expectations of the educational process by the stakeholders. Stakeholders include not only students and faculty but also various groups in both the public and private sectors including industry, professional organizations, funding agencies, state government and the university system. Two specific challenges facing engineering technology educators are 'basic faculty credentials' and changing expectations for 'creative activities'. These two challenges can be delineated by the following questions: ■ Will a doctorate degree be necessary for engineering technology faculty in the future for promotion and tenure in the university environment? ■ Will applied research or pedagogical research be 'good enough' for tenure? This paper addresses these two issues using a study of current engineering technology faculty hiring practices as a basis. Ultimately, critical future discussions must occur as engineering technology education continues to evolve and move into the future. Copyright © 2002 by ASME."

When coupled with the Mobile Studio Desktop software, the system duplicates a large amount of the hardware often used to teach electrical engineering, computer engineering, control systems, physics courses and K-12 technology-oriented courses. The project's goal is to enable hands-on exploration of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education principles, devices, and systems that have historically been restricted to expensive laboratory facilities. The Mobile Studio Project is now being utilized to enhance STEM education around the world. Mobile Studio instrumentation capabilities are similar to those available with traditional, stand alone instruments, but the experience of building a course or outreach activity can be quite different. Thus, a significant milestone for this new pedagogy is the expansion of its use beyond the original core partner institutions. The Mobile Studio learning platform began development at three schools, where it has been used to teach electrical engineering courses for both majors and non-majors. This activity has recently been expanded to additional schools with some notable early success that demonstrates how this approach can be transferred elsewhere, eventually improving programs at the original partner schools. Content development continues at several schools with new partners being added, including some in Africa. In addition to application in electrical engineering education and outreach, Mobile Studio materials are being developed by and for students in adolescent education and computer science at a small liberal arts college.

"Problem-based learning in the training of middle and high school teachers in alternative energy","Guo L.; Tahernezhadi M.","2012","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings","2","Conference paper","EN","The Emerging Technology Institute (ETI) is a collaborative project of Northern Illinois University, Rockford Public School District, West Aurora Unit School District, Rich Township High School District, and Harlem Consolidated School District supported by the Illinois State Board of Education. The main focus of the project is to provide middle school and high school science, math and technology teachers with hands-on interdisciplinary experience with faculty in state-of-the-art laboratories of alternative energy, nanotechnology, fuel cell, and modern manufacturing. The goal of the institute is to improve teachers' content knowledge and teaching practices in ways that increase the academic performance of their students and in ways that build capacity within their schools for continued, sustained student learning. Problem-based learning is a student-centered pedagogy in which students learn about a subject in the context of complex and real problems. The problem drives the learning, as students need to acquire new knowledge and integrate with existing knowledge to solve the problem. In the recent years, problem-based learning (PBL) has seen significant development in engineering and technology education. Compared to the traditional lecturing that is instructor-centered, the PBL approach is an active, student-centered, and problem-centered method. Problem-based learning was first applied in medical science education at medical schools. Recently, PBL approach is used for computer network design, electronics circuit design, biomedical engineering, chemical engineering and physics. The approach has mostly been used for university students. but has not been applied adequately to train middle and high school teachers. This paper describes the alternative energy section in the ETI project. In particular, the paper presents the experience of a structured problem-based learning approach to teach alternative energy to middle and high school teachers. First, the learning objectives were identified. Each participant will discuss the key facts and engineering applications related to solar power; demonstrate understanding of the relevant electric safety when working with solar power system; demonstrate understanding of basic concepts of electric voltage, current, resistance, power and energy; demonstrate understanding of correct procedure to measure voltage, current and power in solar and wind power systems; have increased ability to design alternative energy systems; and write solar and wind technology-based lesson plans to use in his or her classroom. Second, a problem is defined based on the learning objectives. A problem of solar powered flashing light was given to the teacher participants. Small groups of two teacher participants worked collaboratively. The team brainstormed and discussed methods to solve the problem. The faculty member facilitated the learning process and provided consulting to the teacher groups when necessary. Through the group design project, participants demonstrate understanding of relevant electric safety issues and increase their ability to design and implement alternative energy systems. © 2012 American Society for Engineering Education."
"Problem Solving in Real-Life Contexts: An Alternative for Design in Technology Education","Hill A.M.","1998","International Journal of Technology and Design Education","98","Article","EN","This article focuses on one way to study technology, through technological problem solving situated in real-life contexts. In problem solving for real-life contexts, design processes are seen as creative, dynamic and iterative processes that engage exploration; join conceptual and procedural knowledge-both thought and action; and can encourage considerations to technology, human and environmental interactions. This approach is a demarcation from what is typically found in schools; design, make and appraise cycles based on closed design briefs that are teacher assigned and unrelated to the students' world. An interpretation of technology education as problem solving for real-life contexts using design processes as tools for creation and exploration offers an alternative approach to design in technology education. Alternative curriculum and instruction then emerge. Elementary and secondary school programs in technology education and teacher education can all be seen through this kind of design lens. Episodes from case studies are reported with the intent to briefly describe technology education programs in elementary and secondary schools that interpret technology education in this way. Educational implications of this approach are offered."
"TU‐E‐352‐02: Evolving Models of Medical Imaging Physics and Technology Education","Sprawls P.","2008","Medical Physics","0","Conference paper","EN","The effective and safe utilization of the various medical imaging modalities requires professionals (radiologists, medical physicists, and technologists) with a comprehensive and up‐to‐date knowledge of the physical principles of the imaging procedures along with an understanding of the technology and its operating characteristics. Educational activities to meet these needs are characterized and often limited by issues of effectiveness and efficiency. The effectiveness of a activity determines outcomes and whether or not the learner will be capable of performing specific functions such as image quality evaluation, procedure optimization, applying appropriate risk management procedures, to name just a few. The efficiency of a learning activity is determined by a combination of factors including financial cost, human time and effort, and institutional and facility resources. The work of two major pioneers in the educational process, Robert Gagne and Edgar Dale, provide us with an invaluable background and understanding of the learning process, and especially the compromises between effectiveness and efficiency. There are several dynamics driving changes in the medical imaging educational process and resulting in new and evolving models. These include rapid changes in imaging technology and methods, diffusion of the new technologies throughout the global healthcare system, and the need for enriched learning environments and adequately prepared learning facilitators (instructors) at the local level. Continuing advances in digital technology are providing the infrastructure for increasing both the efficiency and effectiveness of medical imaging physics and technology education. This is being achieved by the utilization of technology to enhance (and not replace) human performance of both the learners and learning facilitators and to create enriched learning environments. The models of the educational systems for the future contain a combination of inter‐related functions that together address the changing needs and provide solutions. There are three major phases in the development and delivery of medical imaging physics education. They are educational resource development, resource distribution and sharing, and resource utilization. Each of these is enhanced by the availability of state‐of‐the‐art digital technology but is also dependent on highly qualified and dedicated medical physicists along with institutional and organizational values and objectives. The development of effective learning and teaching resources requires medical physicists with applied clinical experience who also have the capability to transfer the experience into effective learning resources—that is, resources that can be used to enrich learning environments and provide experiences that are as close as possible to actual medical imaging procedures and related activities. The most significant elements in effective learning resources are images and other visual graphics depicting the various imaging technologies and procedures. Clinical images demonstrating the imaging conditions and effects of imaging parameters are essential. A variety of image processing methods are used to create other highly effective teaching images and visuals. It is expected that simulators will become more prevalent in the future that will give learners the opportunity to observe images under interactive conditions. The internet is revolutionizing medical imaging physics education by providing a system for distributing and sharing resources, access to a variety of educational programs, teleteaching, and connectivity to a world‐wide knowledge base. This great value is demonstrated by one example. An educational resource on some major development or issue can be created and then made available around the world within a matter of hours. The technology is relatively mature but there are many organizational and economic issues that must be addressed before the full capability and value of this contribution to education is fully realized. The effective utilization of the growing array of web‐accessible resources to produce the desired outcomes (effective and safe use of medical imaging technology) at the local level is enhanced by experienced medical physicists and institutional commitment and support for the higher levels of learning. Web‐based resources for physics and technology education, especially for radiology residents, fellows, and then practicing radiologists, should support a continuum of integrated learning activities and experiences that typically begin with formal classes. Supervised and mentored clinical activities are major applied physics learning activities where the online resources can be used under the guidance of the radiology and radiological physics faculty to demonstrate many concepts and applications. Preparation for board examinations provides a stimulus for reviewing previously studied resources. Web‐based resources are especially valuable for continuing education/ lifelong learning activities and references for questions and issues that are encountered during a clinical career. Several components and functions of the evolving educational system (classroom lectures, online modules, etc) are analyzed with respect to their effectiveness and efficiency for meeting the educational needs of the medical imaging profession. This course will be of value to all who are involved in medical physics and medical imaging education and who have an interest in the evolution of the process that is occurring now and leading into the future. Educational Objectives: 1. Identify and establish appropriate learning outcomes for specific medical professionals. 2. Establish the types and levels of learning that will be required to produce the desired outcomes. 3. Know the characteristics of learning activities that determine effectiveness. 4. Analyze current or proposed learning activities with respect to efficiency. 5. Understand the characteristics, especially effectiveness and efficiency, of the different models for educational activities. 6. Identify the elements that contribute to an enriched learning environment. 7. Plan and conduct educational activities that maximize effectiveness and efficiency. 8. Develop learning facilitators (faculty) who can optimize their performance as medical physicist educators. 9. Use technology as an appropriate tool in the educational process. 10.

We argue that multimedia students with a liberal arts background need programming competences because programmability is the defining characteristic of the computer medium. We compare programming with the creation of traditional media products and identify two important differences which give rise to extra competences needed by multimedia designers as opposed to traditional media product designers. We analyze the development process of multimedia products in order to incorporate this in the learning process, and based on this we present our vision for a new learning environment for an introductory programming course for multimedia students. We have designed a learning environment called Lingo/and with the new skills of media programming in mind that hopefully can help alleviate the problems we have experienced in teaching programming to liberal arts students."

Over the past 18 years, more than 700 educators and 60,000 students have been impacted by the program, which features integration of engineering design challenges into other disciplines of learning from literature to science and mathematics to art. For the past 12 years, DTEACh has focused on teaching automation and control concepts with robotics as the medium. This paper describes an evaluation of recent modifications to the institute implementation and advancements in the design methodology. In particular, changes to the institute feature: (1) contextualization of the design problems within the 21st Century Engineering Grand Challenges; and (2) increased focus on the pedagogy of design-based teaching and learning. These changes were implemented in response to: (1) research that shows females and other traditionally underrepresented groups are more attracted to and interested in design challenges that have a relationship to broader impacts on humanity and (2) indications that participants need more insight into how engineering can be integrated into their classrooms. A main goal of evaluating the evolution and impact of this program on STEM education is to understand the effect of the changes in content and approach in relation to the improved efficacy of the teachers. The evaluation is based on teachers' responses to daily surveys on the design-based/project-based aspects of the PDI. The evaluation also includes open-ended question assessment throughout the institute and end-of-institute assessment. The mixed-methods evaluation methodology includes correlation of responses with the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality types of the participants, which is used in the institute to help form design teams. Data for the 2010 institute were collected using the same instrument employed in the 2004 institute, allowing a longitudinal analysis of the effects of changes to the institute. The analysis indicates that the modifications to PDI have had meaningful impacts across MBTI personality types. The teachers, on average and across the all MBTI types, mostly agreed or totally agreed that the instruction and laboratory aspects of the PDI were relevant to them each day. Multiple teachers commented that they enjoyed the ""tag-team"" effort of multiple instructors with different specialties. Our results indicate that other PDI developers should consider the NAE Grand Challenges to provide context and relevance to their offerings. © 2011 American Society for Engineering Education."
"Science and Technology Education in the STES Context in Primary Schools: What Should It Take?","Zoller U.","2011","Journal of Science Education and Technology","15","Article","EN","Striving for sustainability requires a paradigm shift in conceptualization, thinking, research and education, particularly concerning the science-technology-environment-society (STES) interfaces. Consequently, 'STES literacy' requires the development of students' question asking, critical, evaluative system thinking, decision making and problem solving capabilities, in this context, via innovative implementable higher-order cognitive skills (HOCS)-promoting teaching, assessment and learning strategies. The corresponding paradigms shift in science and technology education, such as from algorithmic teaching to HOCS-promoting learning is unavoidable, since it reflects the social pressure, worldwide, towards more accountable socially- and environmentally-responsible sustainable development. Since most of the STES- and, recently STEM (science-technology-engineering-mathematics)-related research in science education has been focused on secondary and tertiary education, it is vital to demonstrate the relevance of this multifaceted research to the science and technology teaching in primary schools. Our longitudinal STES education-related research and curriculum development point to the very little contribution, if any, of the traditional science teaching to ""know"", to the development of students' HOCS capabilities. On the other hand, there appears to be a 'general agreement', that the contemporary dominant lower-order cognitive skills (LOCS) teaching and assessment strategies applied in science and technology education are, in fact, restraining the natural curiosity and creativity of primary school (and younger?) pupils/children. Since creative thinking as well as evaluative system thinking, decision making, problem solving and transfer constitute an integral part of the HOCS conceptual framework, the appropriateness of ""HOCS promoting"" teaching, and the relevance of science and technology, to elementary education in the STES context, is apparent. Therefore, our overriding guiding purpose was to provide any evidence-based research to the vital LOCS-to-HOCS paradigm shift in STES education. The findings of, and conclusions derived from our longitudinal research on HOCS development within STES-oriented and traditional education, suggest that both-science and technology education (STE) and STES education-are relevant to primary school education. Based on this, what it should take to insure success in this context, is thoroughly discussed. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

"Engineering technology as a vehicle for putting qualified technology teachers in high school classrooms","Rockland R.; Kimmel H.; Carpinelli J.; Bloom J.","2008","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings","0","Conference paper","EN","Increasing the presence of engineering and technology in K-12 education has become a high priority for the nation's industrial future. Most middle and high school students and many of their teachers still do not have a positive attitude towards these fields and/or lack an understanding of the role of engineering, as well as the role of engineers and engineering technologists. How do we meet this challenge of bringing knowledge of these fields into K-12 classrooms? Various professional development programs have been developed and implemented by higher education institutions and educational organizations to help teachers acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to bring these concepts into their classrooms. But the availability of teacher preparation programs has not kept pace. Technology education, as a discipline, is relatively young, and is an outgrowth of the industrial arts program. Many educators consider the publication of the Jackson's Mill Industrial Arts Curriculum Theory document in 1981 as the starting point of the modern era of technology education. 1The rapidly increasing number of high school pre-engineering programs across the country has created a growing shortage of teachers qualified to teach such courses. Only recently have some states, such as New Jersey, revised their teacher certification code to authorize a ""Teacher of Technology"" certification or endorsement, and only one higher education institution in our state has had authorization to provide programs leading to teacher certification in Technology Education. Our university, New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) does not have a teacher preparation program. However, we have established collaboration with a teacher preparation program in a neighboring institution in which our students earn their degree at NJIT, while earning teaching certification from the other institution. Several alternative programs were examined as possible vehicles for training teachers for the technology education certification. Currently, NJIT undergraduates are able to earn engineering degrees and then acquire teacher certification through the Department of Urban Education of Rutgers University - Newark. It was concluded that this may not be the best approach to increase the number of teachers. We have developed a program specifically for undergraduates who can earn a degree in Engineering Technology, while getting appropriate training in educational background and methods. This paper will describe the development of the program, its rationale, and the educational component of the program that will be putting qualified technology education teachers in high school classrooms."

This paper focuses on the shift in skill set from teaching in a predefned drawing mode to that of a conceptual mode that fosters creativity. As technical sketching is a fundamental building block of all design-based activities, it formed the core of this study. Focusing on the learning process under the descriptors of presage, process and product enabled a linear exploration of an otherwise complex dynamic learning experience. Although the perception of innate ability restricts the level of application of many teachers in terms of sketching, it proved a valuable attribute as a comparative criterion when selecting contributors. The study included participants that subjectively claimed an average standard of sketching capabilities and a polar group with a prerequisite mindset governed by the phrase ""I cannot sketch"". All participants completed a purpose designed fve-week course of study. Te course included much psychomotor skill development; however the signifcant value of the course content centred on the cognitive development that progressed from knowledge acquisition to synthesis. The paper concludes by highlighting the value of ""Process"" based education over the traditional ""Product"" approach and presents empirical evidence that illustrate enhanced cognitive capabilities of the participants. The use of pre and post intervention data and qualitative commentary validates the suggestion that there is a greater cognitive value to sketching than a completed composition."

"Development of STEAM program Math centered for Middle School Students","Kim E.J.; Kim S.H.; Nam D.S.; Lee T.W.","2012","Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Computers in Education, ICCE 2012","2","Conference paper","EN","Now as a society of knowledge and information, it is required the develoment of autonomous and creative human resources that can create new intellectual value using the knowledge and information given by rather than simply memorizing the knowledge. In terms of development of creativity, mathematics is a very important subject. However, many students do not feel the need and the value of mathematics and they just study without any interests. So looking at the buzzword of these days, STEAM. STEAM is the fusion of five fields of studies which are science, technology, engineering, art, mathematics. In the early advanced study it can be seen that using STEAM, education has a positive impact on attitudes and interests. And computer programming enhances students' algorithmic thinking in mathematics. Therefore, this research wants to develop STEAM program centered with mathematics using scratch to improve the mathematical interests of students."
"Exploring a valid and reliable assessment of engineering and technology education learning in the classroom","Caplan M.","2010","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings","0","Conference paper","EN","It is common knowledge that No Child Left Behind (NCLB) created a system of accountability that established a baseline for determining school success. To assess student performance, NCBL uses the results of standardized assessments in traditional disciplines. Since engineering and technology education is not one of the traditional disciplines, only 12 states have engineering and technology education as a requirement. In International Technology Education Association (ITEA) report on the status of technology education in the U.S in 2004, it is clear that there is an interest to include engineering and technology education as part of the overall learning experience. Some of the possible reasons why engineering and technology education are not one of the core subjects are: the limited established academic structures, lack of qualified teachers, clear assessments policies and instruments and administrative conflicts. In order for engineering and technology education to be accepted as a core subject among others, it will be necessary to address the mentioned issues. Critics complain regarding the lack of valid and reliable assessment methodologies, therefore it is necessary for the educational community, to explore and develop valid and reliable assessment tools specific for engineering and technology education. When teaching engineering and technology, the expectation is that students will demonstrate their acquired knowledge through the design of projects that will serve as an alternative assessment. To encourage the creativity of the students, it is desirable to use self-directed projects, where students decide and select the project they will design, which will be then graded through a rubric. The structure and assessment protocol for the self-directed project will be introduced and discussed in conjunction with samples of different projects produced by students at the college level in the ""Science and Technology in the Arts"" course at a urban art and media communication liberal arts and science college. This structure includes 1) a procedure to guide students in the generation of the ""Definition of the project"", 2) the generation of a valid and reliable rubric to assess the project and 3) instructions for the evaluators on how to use the assessment tool. The analysis of the data collected by the writer during the past two years shows a strong correlation between the students', quizzes and final examination, with the grade of their self-selected project. In conclusion, it is possible to develop and implement a model that will allow engineering and technology education instructors to assess the content, skills and values learned by their students when each student is working in a self-selected project. This model will make possible for the instructor to objectively assess what the students know with a strong level of validity and reliability. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2010."
"We're Creative on a Friday Afternoon: Investigating Children's Perceptions of their Experience of Design & Technology in Relation to Creativity","Benson C.; Lunt J.","2011","Journal of Science Education and Technology","6","Article","EN","In the last 15 years there has been an increased emphasis in both educational research and curriculum development upon investigating children's perspectives of their experience of learning. Children naturally have very particular and important insights to offer in helping us to develop our understanding of teaching and learning. However, research into children's perceptions in the field of primary Design & Technology education is still at a very early stage (Lunt in International handbook of research and development in technology education, Sense Publishers, Utrecht, 2009a). For example, in three reviews of educational research in Design & Technology (Kimbell in A guide to educational research, The Woburn Publishers, London, 1996; Eggleston in Teaching and learning design and technology: a guide to recent research and its applications, Continuum, London, 2000; Harris and Wilson in Designs on the curriculum? A review of the literature on the impact of design and technology in schools, Department for Education and Skills, London, 2003) there are only passing references made to eliciting and considering pupils' views and, in the studies where it does occur, it is used as a supplementary method of data collection rather than as a focus of research. The work which exists is small-scale and the majority of studies relate to secondary-aged pupils. The research that we have recently undertaken has tried to redress this gap. It has focused on primary children's (aged 9-11 years) perceptions of Design & Technology in general (Benson and Lunt in PATT 18 international conference on design and technology educational research: teaching and learning technological literacy in the classroom, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, 2007) and latterly creativity in Design & Technology. It has been claimed by many that Design & Technology is a 'creative' subject which develops children's creative abilities. This is a bold claim and one that needs careful consideration. This paper sets out a framework for thinking about creativity drawn from a review of the literature and uses evidence of children's perceptions of their experience of Design & Technology to compare practice with theory in an attempt to raise questions and issues relevant to both policy and practice. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."
"Mission creep in engineering technology education?","Rennels K.","2003","ASEE Annual Conference Proceedings","3","Conference paper","EN","At this juncture in the development of engineering technology education, it is critical not to lose sight of the mission of engineering technology. Two specific challenges to the engineering technology traditional mission are the issues of 'basic faculty credentials' and changing expectations for 'creative activities'. These two challenges can be delineated by the following questions: Will a doctorate degree be necessary for engineering technology faculty in the future for promotion and tenure in the university environment? Will applied research or pedagogical research be 'good enough'? This paper addresses these two issues by analyzing a research study of current engineering technology faculty hiring practices. Data are presented showing the change in faculty credentials and faculty hiring practices over the last two years. Ultimately, discussion within the engineering technology community must occur as engineering technology education continues to evolve and move into the future."
"Work in progress: Designing an innovative curriculum for engineering in high school (ICE-HS)","Virani S.; Burnham I.B.; Gonzalez V.; Barua M.; Fredericksen E.; Andrade S.J.","2011","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings","1","Conference paper","EN","The projected job growth for Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) professionals is expected to be 22% as reported by the Occupational Outlook quarterly in spring 2007. According to the National Science Foundation, only about 17 percent of U.S. college graduates earned a degree in subjects related to STEM; this falls well below the world average of 26 percent. In order to fulfill this projected need, state governments have initiated STEM education programs in high schools across the country. The challenge faced by high school administrators and teachers is not only to develop a new set of modules for engineering, but also to imbed innovative pedagogy while implementing them. Moreover, they are faced with the task of identifying the scope and sequence of engineering education at a high school level. Traditionally, high school students were introduced to engineering during summer camps at a college of engineering. The summer camp or out-reach activities were university developed and delivered. Seldom did they last more than a few weeks. Exemplary vendor-sold curricula such as Project Lead the Way and Infinity provided the scope and sequence for teaching engineering in high school. They also assisted schools in the form of training, teaching materials, and web support. Agencies such as NSF and ASEE have developed engineering education websites such as egfi.org, teachengineering.org, and cadrek12.org that are not utilized by the vendor-sold curricula. Expense and investment in teacher implementation training time remain important factor in implementing vendor- sold curricula. The ICE-HS presents a step-by -step methodology for developing a four- year high school engineering curriculum framework based on backward design and systems thinking approaches. The ICE-HS is structured around two major objectives: attracting the high school students to STEM and providing a flexible engineering foundation. It does not prescribe specific modules but offers integration with the other disciplines such as language/arts and traditional science courses. The ICE-HS is currently being piloted in a charter high school, Da Vinci School for Science and the Arts. The ICE-HS uses the modules developed by several sources such as NSF and ASEE and provides a framework that allows the school to customize its delivery for appropriate grades and levels. The main contributions of this framework are the defined scope and sequence and the outcomes and rubrics that utilize an array of publicly available resources for teaching engineering throughout the high school. © 2011 American Society for Engineering Education."

"K-12 and university collaboration: A vehicle to improve curriculum and female enrollment in engineering and technology","Gralinski T.; Terpenny J.P.","2003","ASEE Annual Conference Proceedings","6","Conference paper","EN","In 1993, the State of Massachusetts enacted the Educational Reform Act to improve student performance and to increase school accountability. One of the curriculum frameworks of this initiative is titled Science and Technology/Engineering. One of the strands within that framework, Technology/Engineering, outlines standards in seven curriculum areas to be assessed at the high school level on the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS). This framework is somewhat controversial but supported by numerous surveys focusing on national needs. The movement of traditional Industrial Arts programs to a Technology/Engineering approach in both delivery and content has created a new set of problems with questions raised about the preparedness of existing Technology Education teachers to teach pre-engineering and engineering curricula. In addition there have been questions raised about the lack of female enrollment in engineering and technology classes. This paper describes the collaboration of Amherst Regional High School (ARHS) with faculty at the University of Massachusetts and Hampshire College in addressing issues impinging the success of engineering and technology curricula. More specifically, this collaboration has focused on: reviewing and enhancing high school teacher's core knowledge of engineering design, the curricular changes made based on this study/research, and research of gender equity issues in engineering and technology curricula. Plans to recruit and retain female students in the technology/engineering area at both secondary and university levels are described; including, cross-institutional projects with an emphasis on assistive technologies and universal design, and a variety of outreach activities between institutions. A structure that provides for on-going collaboration between the local high school and area colleges is also provided."
"Attracting K-12 students towards engineering disciplines with project based learning modules","Verma A.K.","2011","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings","3","Conference paper","EN","Low enrollment and high attrition rates in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) based degree programs have created a workforce problem in industries like shipbuilding and repair which are important for national security. Part of this problem can be attributed to pedagogical issues like lack of engaging hands-on activities utilized for science and math education in middle and high schools. Lack of student interest in technical careers can also be attributed to lack of an integrated approach in teaching math, science and technical education. To engage student's interest in the technical career path, it is important that students establish a link between the theoretical knowledge and its application to solve real life problems early in their learning experience. Project based activities have a proven record as instructional tool. Effectiveness of such activities as a pedagogical tool has been supported by research in the acquisition and retention of knowledge. Two projects funded by the National Science Foundation and National Shipbuilding Research Program have attempted to address the workforce issue for marine industry by developing project based learning kits and associated instructional modules to engage K-12 students in STEM tracks and increase awareness about shipbuilding and repair careers. Four marine kits and four instructional modules were developed under these two grants to encourage creative thinking and keep students engaged in shipbuilding and repair processes. The teacher training component of these projects has provided training in using and implementing these modules.

"Enhancing learning through innovative technology: Education in ‘surf equipment, design, materials and construction’ course","Audy J.","2008","Enhancing Learning Through Technology: Research on Emerging Technologies and Pedagogies","0","Book chapter","EN","This chapter deals with results obtained through active research conducted between 2004 and 2007 in the ‘Surf Equipment, Design Materials and Construction’ course unit. This 2nd year unit is offered at Edith Cowan (ECU) University (South West Campus) in Bunbury (W.A., Australia) as part of the Surf Science and Technology (SST) course. It aims to engage students in research and technological activities related to design modelling, materials' selection, optimisation procedures, and performance testing when working on their individualised fins and surfboards. So far, only little has been published about the effects of surfboard/fin design and materials on performance and durability, and from this, it is clear that the opinion of various users and designers on the importance of surfboard design features with respect to performance is in conflict. Consequently, the driving force and rationale for this study is associated with four principal issues. The first one looks at the need for technology education to respond in a quicker and more flexible way in order to keep up to date with advances in scientific, technological and industrial fields. The second one deals with the necessity to gain a deeper understanding of Australia's industry needs in order to stay competitive in the worldwide market and prepare a universal ‘generic’ teaching module for teaching, learning and training purposes to address such issues. The third one considers the need to eliminate the use of expensive testing equipment that is not always available in remote campuses, and to devise the test and facilities for carrying out experiments and training exercises from available resources in order to get both reliable and accurate results from a practical point of view. Finally, the fourth one deals with the necessity to better understand the students' diversity and technical decision-making ability and to reflect on it properly in practice in order to make technology education more attractive to a wider student audience. In this study, over the course of several units the students were taught to understand materials, art and design-related features, quality management, standards and safety engineering. After acquiring the necessary skills, they were encouraged to design, produce and test their own fins and surfboards. In an open learning environment they felt free to combine research science with hands-on skills to develop their ideas. The teaching mode involved lecturer's assistance (by face-to-face and/or via websites), including videos and the additional presence of professional shapers. On completion, each student was required to submit an individual project report and prepare materials for a 15 minute debate for sharing ideas, results and achievements with group members. To assist in the analysis of the sample results, and to provide a quantitative comparison of relative importance of each qualitative criterion with respect to other criteria associated with surfboard design features and performance, a statistical method was established. This allowed the results to be discussed from both qualitative and quantitative points of view and to create a mutually involving and stimulating topic for the students and the lecturer. This information assisted in the optimisation of fins and surfboards. The students' attitudes to project-related issues and effectiveness of teaching initiatives were evaluated from pre-tests and post-tests — group design — experiments and surveys. It was found that those students who worked closely with experienced supervisors believed that they were better prepared for solving technically-oriented problems in design and production, and reported more satisfaction with their individually designed surfboards and fins than those relying on web-sites and video links. © 2008 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

Part of this problem can be attributed to pedagogical issues like lack of engaging hands-on activities utilized for science and math education in middle and high schools. Lack of student interest in technical careers can also be attributed to lack of an integrated approach in teaching math, science and technical education. To engage student's interest in the technical career path, it is important that students establish a link between the theoretical knowledge and its application to solve real life problems early in their learning experience. Project based activities have a proven record as instructional tool. Effectiveness of such activities as a pedagogical tool has been supported by research in the acquisition and retention of knowledge. Marine Career Tech (McTech) project funded by the National Science Foundation has attempted to address the workforce issues for marine industry by developing instructional modules for community college students and organizing Shipbuilding Repair and Maritime Career Day Events (SBRCD) to engage K-12 students in STEM careers. The goal is to increase awareness about shipbuilding and repair careers. Four marine kits and four instructional modules were developed under these two grants to encourage creative thinking and keep students engaged in shipbuilding and repair processes. The teacher training component of these projects has provided training in using and implementing these modules. The paper presents the results from community college faculty workshops and from the survey of SBRCD events. © 2012 American Society for Engineering Education."
"Observational study of students' individual heuristics when solving technological problems","Spillane J.G.; Seery N.; Canty D.; Lane D.","2012","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings","1","Conference paper","EN","The overall aim of education is the development of creative, critical thinking and problem-solving future citizens who will be able to positively contribute (individually and collectively) to society. Yet, research has highlighted the misalignment between theory (curriculum) and practice (teaching practices, learning experiences) in the attainment of this aim. The objective of technology education is to produce technologically capable and literate people. Problem-solving and value judgements have been highlighted as critical areas in the development of technological capability [1] and technological literacy [2]. This paper investigates students' (12 to 15-year-olds) individual heuristics when problem solving during a prescribed ICT based computer task. The program attempts to elicit critical thinking and reasoning skills (deductive/abductive/ inductive). The development and application of these skills became apparent as students progressed through the task. Web-capture software was used to track each student's progress and monitor their decision making. A multidimensional problem-solving framework was employed when observing participants attempts. The problem-solving framework looked at four key stages: Identifying, Planning, Implementing, and Evaluating. This was supported by the sub-cycle of conjecture, test, and evaluate (accept/reject) method presented by Carlson and Bloom [3] used to analyse mathematical problem-solving. Simultaneously audio responses were also captured, which gave researchers a valuable and rich data set to interpret individual heuristics, conceptual knowledge and decision making. The findings presented in this paper illustrate a clear connection between Attitudes, Skills and Knowledge (ASK) and the development of strategic knowledge and successful problem solving. The use of both conscious and subconscious recognition of signage, symbolism and pattern recognition in the problem-solving process provided the researcher with insight into the type of individual heuristics employed and the performance efficacy of student attempts. © 2012 American Society for Engineering Education."
"A proposed approach to design an efficient program in industrial technology","Gadalla M.","2002","ASEE Annual Conference Proceedings","0","Conference paper","EN","Technology education at the university level can be grouped into: Engineering Technology (ET) and Industrial Technology (IT) Programs. These programs are primarily focusing on applications in Engineering Science. A typical IT curriculum includes: hands-on type of experience courses, courses on humanities, liberal arts, physiology, management, economic, etc. The graduates of these programs are workforce that can be used in many workplaces such as: industry, government, educational institutes, financial institutions, etc. Although the graduate of IT programs has a wide scope of knowledge in many areas, he or she can still suffer from a lack of some fundamentals in mathematics, and core courses that are considered as core elements in building a sound skeleton of a scientific knowledge. It is believed that by efficient design of the IT curriculum many of these pitfalls can be avoided. In this paper a case study of a program design and development in industrial technology in Computer Integrated Design and Manufacturing Technology (CIDMT) will be shown. The conflicting factors to be considered and resolved in the curriculum design will be highlighted and discussed."
"Techniques for visualizing data structures in algorithmic animations","Esponda-Argüero M.","2010","Information Visualization","4","Article","EN","This paper deals with techniques for the design and production of appealing algorithmic animations and their use in computer science education. A good visual animation is both a technical artifact and a work of art that can greatly enhance the understanding of an algorithm's workings. In the first part of the paper, I show that awareness of the composition principles used by other animators and visual artists can help programmers to create better algorithmic animations. The second part shows how to incorporate those ideas in novel animation systems, which represent data structures in a visually intuitive manner. The animations described in this paper have been implemented and used in the classroom for courses at university level. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Ltd."
"Designing, visualizing, and discussing algorithms within a CS 1 studio experience: An empirical study","Hundhausen C.D.; Brown J.L.","2008","Computers and Education","29","Article","EN","Within the context of an introductory CS1 unit on algorithmic problem-solving, we are exploring the pedagogical value of a novel active learning activity-the ""studio experience""-that actively engages learners with algorithm visualization technology. In a studio experience, student pairs are tasked with (a) developing a solution to an algorithm design problem, (b) constructing an accompanying visualization with a storyline, and finally (c) presenting that visualization for feedback and discussion in a session modeled after an architectural ""design crit."" Is a studio experience educationally valuable? What kind of technology can best support it? To explore these questions, we conducted an empirical study of two alternative CS1 studio experiences in which students used one of two different kinds of algorithm development and visualization technology: (a) a text editor coupled with art supplies, or (b) ALVIS Live!, a computer-based algorithm development and visualization tool. We found that the students who used ALVIS Live! developed algorithms with significantly fewer semantic errors. Moreover, discussions mediated by ALVIS Live! had significantly more student audience contributions, and retained a sharper focus on the specific details of algorithm behavior, leading to the collaborative identification and repair of semantic errors. In addition, discussions mediated by both ALVIS Live! and art supplies contained substantial evidence of higher order thinking. Based on our results, we make recommendations for educators interested in exploring studio-based approaches, and we propose an agenda for future research into studio-based learning in computer science education. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

"Whither scheme? 21st century approaches to scheme in CS1","Brown R.; Davis J.; Rebelsky S.A.; Harvey B.","2009","SIGCSE'09 - Proceedings of the 40th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education","1","Conference paper","EN","Since the decline of Pascal as a ""standard"" introductory language in the late 1970's and early 1980's, faculty members have adopted (and, often, discarded) a variety of languages for the introductory course: C, C++, Java, Modula-2, Ada, Python, Ruby, and more. Different approaches and different opinions have led to a number of ""language wars"" in the SIGCSE community, wars that we hope to avoid in this panel. Throughout this period, Scheme has had a constant audience. A wide variety of schools, from small liberal arts colleges to major research universities, have adopted and stuck with Scheme. Many begin with Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP) [1], although a wide variety of approaches have evolved since then. To its adopters, Scheme has many strengths, including a simple syntax, a small language definition, the ability to consider multiple paradigms, and the power of higher-order programming. The Scheme community remains strong, in part, because of DrScheme [3], an open-source development environment appropriate for novices. Although DrScheme was developed in the context of How to Design Programs [2] and the TeachScheme project (which provides its own 21st century approach to Scheme in CS1), DrScheme is used in a wide variety of contexts. More than twenty years have passed since the publication of SICP. In those twenty years, the face of computing has changed significantly. When modern students think of computing, they think of things like Google, Wikis, graphics, games, and more. Is there still a role for Scheme in this new world of computing? In this panel, we consider some ways in which introductory courses currently use Scheme, strategies that preserve the strengths of Scheme while incorporating ""new computing""."
"Experiences with Just-in-Time Teaching in systems and design courses","Davis J.","2009","SIGCSE'09 - Proceedings of the 40th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education","12","Conference paper","EN","I report on my experiences with Just-in-Time Teaching (JiTT) in two systems courses and two design courses as a new instructor at a small liberal arts college. My purposes are threefold: to further raise awareness of JiTT in the computer science education community, to show instructors can achieve JiTT's goals with simple technology and preparation on the fly, and to consider strengths and limitations of the approach, particularly for new faculty. My experience has been very positive: classes have been fun, engaging, and conversational. Students have reported that they come to class better prepared and appreciate the opportunity to ask and discuss questions before class. Where others have warned of the high workload with this approach, my experience is that the workload is reasonable compared to preparing a new course from scratch; the approach discourages some types of overpreparation. For these reasons, I would recommend the approach for other new instructors. © 2009 ACM."
"Implementing engineering-based learning in Boston Arts Academy high school STEM courses","Zeid I.F.; Gonzalez R.; Wallace C.","2012","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings","0","Conference paper","EN","The Boston Arts Academy is a unique urban high school in that its curriculum is devoted to the intersection of arts and academics. Our school believes that art is essential to our students' learning, and it is necessary for us to integrate arts into our STEM courses. Our school curriculum is packed, so it is difficult for us to add new courses. Therefore, we needed to change our pedagogical approaches to find ways to connect theory to practice, which has resulted in our creation of STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and math) as a guiding philosophy. We need to show our students the use of STEAM concepts in real-life applications. In searching for a solution to change the way we teach high school students STEM courses, we found a new and unique program called CAPSULE offered by Northeastern University. The approach uses engineering-based learning (EBL). Thus, two teachers (one teaches chemistry and one teaches physics/math) from our school attended the Professional Development (PD), offered as part of an NSF grant. Unlike traditional pedagogical approaches such as the 4E and 5E models and the scientific method, the EBL pedagogical approach provides two benefits. First, it contextualizes the STEM concepts and makes the underlying mathematical or scientific principles more relevant to the student, and in doing so it generates challenges and excitement. It is our hypothesis that by adding EBL as an organizing principle to our STEM classes, this will lead to increased student achievement and interest in STEM education as measured by the number of students taking elective science and math classes and the number of students selecting STEM careers. Second, the EBL provides a general framework, skill set and tools that are applicable to any STEM subject or course. That is possible because EBL pedagogy uses the engineering design process (EDP) and the college-level known capstone experience. The paper will cover the details of our implementations of EBL in our courses, the changes we have made, the obstacles we faced in integrating EBL into our chemistry and physics/math courses, the results, students' reactions and feedback, and what we have learned. We also present how we implemented our action plans we developed during the PD in our classrooms. One important lesson we have learned is to build capacity in the same high school, i.e. the more teachers who train and use the EBL methodology, the better and more effective the implementation and the support system are as teachers can bounce ideas off of each other. © 2012 American Society for Engineering Education."

"The problem in technology education (A definite article)","Flowers J.","2010","Journal of Technology Education","7","Article","EN","As with any field, technology education and its close relatives have numerous strengths and weaknesses. One of these weaknesses has too long been overlooked, and it is the subject of this article. We might think of technology education as empowering students, divergently fostering their own creativity. An abundance of design briefs shows that this field seems to encourage students to develop diverse and creative solutions to technological problems. It is ironic, therefore, that dogmatism is prevalent in the curriculum, literature, and research in technology education. In this sense, dogmatism refers to ""a positive, arrogant assertion of opinion"" (Neufeldt, 1997, p. 404) (if you'll pardon my arrogant assertion of this claim.) This article focuses not on larger, overt examples of dogmatism that can easily be spotted, but on small and subtle ones, taking a very narrow approach to attempt to identify some instances of dogmatism in technology education literature by focusing on dogmatic uses of a single EN word the to falsely imply uniqueness. Illustrative examples are examined with the hope of beginning recognition of this problem by our field. There was no intention to review the corpus of literature in technology education according the classifications of definite articles, though the classification systems can inform the analysis."
"Evaluation of cooperative competition as an educational strategy in project-oriented technology education","Helps C.R.G.; Patterson M.A.","2004","ASEE Annual Conference Proceedings","2","Conference paper","EN","Competitions can create an effective learning environment by engaging students in active and cooperative learning. And while competition and cooperation are usually considered by educational researchers to be opposites, they can be used in conjunction to support learning. This study discusses the results of teaching upper-division and graduate-level technology courses that include a competitive project as a major part of the class. In this setting, students design and construct electronics projects, with ample opportunity for creative expression. The project goal is clearly defined, but the solution is not strongly constrained, and students work in teams to find it. In turn, the cooperation among team members and the competition between teams, and often, the cooperation between teams as well, all serve to motivate the students and enhance various aspects of learning. This approach was used with two different groups of technology students at two universities. Student response was evaluated using qualitative evaluation techniques and analyzed for trends and student impact. We also report on how to design a competition-based course to meet educational needs."

"The Ekranoplan vehicle design project","Leonhardt E.","2004","ASEE Annual Conference Proceedings","1","Conference paper","EN","The Ekranoplan project offers technology educators an additional inexpensive and creative design project that is appropriate for students from middle school through university. The project excites students about technology while motivating them to learn math and science using a team-oriented environment. The project utilizes learning objectives that may be tied to standardized assessments. Masters of Education candidates at Western Washington University developed the Ekranoplan vehicle project during a Technology Education course. An Ekranoplan or Wing-In-Ground Effect vehicle flies very close to a water surface. The vehicle uses design elements of both airplanes and marine craft. Ground-effect flight enables a vehicle to carry either a larger payload or operate with greater fuel efficiency than a conventional airplane. The candidates tested several vehicle configurations, power sources and construction techniques. Vehicle construction guidelines and curriculum outlines were developed to disseminate to other technology educators.
